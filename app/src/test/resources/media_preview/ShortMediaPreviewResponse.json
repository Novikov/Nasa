There were steep drops in the rate at which particles that originate inside the heliosphere hit the instrument's radiation detector. At the same time, there were significant increases in the rate at which particles that originate outside our heliosphere (also known as galactic cosmic rays) hit the detector.  The graphs show data from Voyager 2's CRS, which averages the number of particle hits over a six-hour block of time. CRS detects both lower-energy particles that originate inside the heliosphere (greater than 0.5 MeV) and higher-energy particles that originate farther out in the galaxy (greater than 70 MeV).   https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22924",

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 47: Astronaut MD.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So if you're new to the show, we bring in NASA experts to talk about all the different parts of our space agency.  And sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to tell their story.  So today we're chatting with Serena Aunon-Chancellor.  She's a US astronaut, and she's about to launch to the International Space Station for her first space flight.  She told us about her education going for engineering and medicine, her time at NASA as a flight surgeon, and her training and expectations before her first trip to space.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Serena Aunon-Chancellor.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    T minus five seconds and counting.  Mark.     [Inaudible] there she goes.    Houston, we have a podcast.     [ Music ]    Host: Serena, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, absolutely.    Host: You were really busy beforehand.  You actually had to run --     [ Laughter ]    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: That's right.    Host: And we're actually doing it while you're here, too.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: That's right, that's right.  Collecting science happens 24/7 prior to flight.    Host: Oh my gosh.  Well, I really appreciate your time honestly.  Because now that you're about to go to the International Space Station, this is the perfect time to sit down and kind of go through your story.  So let's just start with that.  Let's just start from the beginning.  You said you were born in Indiana, but you're more of a Colorado girl, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, absolutely.  And so my father worked at Purdue University for many years.  And then when I was in junior high school he went to go work for Colorado State University.  And for me, high school was kind of my formative -- I consider those a lot of my formative years.  And it was just a beautiful place to live and grow up.  And I made tons of great friend there.  And you're making that all-important transition from high school to college, which was a big leap.  And I remember at the time thinking, \"God, I want to leave home.  I don't want to be here.\"  And I look back on that now and I think, \"Are you crazy?  Colorado's beautiful.\"  But I really wanted to be someplace new, and exciting, and different.  And I love Washington, D.C. Funny enough, both my parents went to the same undergraduate institution, George Washington University --    Host: Oh, no way.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: -- like I did.  And I think initially they were all for it, but they said, \"Look around some more.\"  I said, \"No, I love it here.  I love DC.  I love the big city, and I love being where a lot of things happen.\"    Host: Yeah [Laughs].  So that was your undergrad, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: That's correct.    Host: So that was going there, and then you kind of moved around from there.  But did your inspiration for pursuing -- this was when you were at George Washington, you were pursuing an engineering degree, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: That's correct.  So I entered my undergraduate program as an electrical engineer.  And my father was an electrical engineer.    Host: So where did that inspiration come from?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Where did that inspiration come from?  And again, part of this is stemming from hey, I want to work for NASA someday.    Host: Oh, okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I knew when my parents sat down with me, my father, of course, was like, \"You want to work for NASA?  You be an engineer.\"  And so I was good at math and science.  I really enjoyed the engineering curriculum.  But interestingly enough, as I began that curriculum I had finished my sophomore year at GW.  And most of my friends were pre-med engineers, which I didn't even know that curriculum existed.  I didn't know that engineering and medicine had a combined track.    Host: Yeah.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And they all came to me and said, \"Serena, we think you should be a doctor.  You're great around people.  And we think you should look at this program.\"  So I have to credit my friends who -- you know, a lot of folks think that college kids are just trying to find their way through life.  They had a lot of insight.  And those friends shared that insight with me.  So I went home over the summer, talked about it with my mom and dad, and said, \"I think I need to do this.\"  And they said, \"Okay, we'll support you.\"  Took a couple classes at home over the summer to catch back up with some of the prereq's I hadn't finished and then came back on board my junior year as a pre-med engineer.  So it was -- and from that point on, it was neat because I got to take some classes in biomedical engineering as well as a senior.  And I really enjoyed the way you could combine the human body or medicine and engineering at that time.    Host: That's actually my main question here, is I'm -- I don't think I see the connection between electrical engineering and pre-med.  They seem to different.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: They seem so different.  The interesting thing is -- and especially when you work at NASA today, NASA is all about engineering.  No question.  And about the different systems.  And so what -- I still give lots of talks to engineering communities.  And I say, you know, when you look at a space ship or you look at the station, you've got the electrical power system, you've got the system that provides cooling and life support.  You've got the system that takes care of waste.  Well, that human body is another system that you're putting inside the larger system.  The only thing that the human body is, it's not a -- it's a system you have to be very careful with.  And unlike other engineering components that you can test to failure, you can't do that with a human body.  And the human body is so variable.  You have some folks that can tolerate really hot environments really well and some folks that can't.  And so having that human system integrated into the larger system of the Space Station is one of the biggest challenges that we deal with today.    Host: So was it mainly this idea that you were good with people that your friends really pushed you to pursue medicine, or was it maybe some other connection?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I think it was just the fact that I related well to people.  And I still --    Host: Oh, okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Because I still practice medicine actively today.  Medicine is one of those fields where you have to approach a person wherever they're at.  And folks -- I treat folks from all walks of life at all points in their life.  And it can be a challenge to walk into a room and within five to ten seconds try and judge where this person's coming from, what are their concerns, how do you approach them when you talk to them?  And so, you know, I think -- at least I like to think my friends saw that I was easily able to approach people and tried to approach them with kind of a down-to-earth sort of attitude and make them feel comfortable.    Host: Okay.  So was it -- did you know what kind of medicine you wanted to go into when you started this?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No idea.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: None -- none, none, none.     [ Laughter ]    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No idea [Laughs].    Host: So the pre was truly, like, \"All right, let me just get introduced to this field and see what I want to do.\"    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Exactly.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Exactly.  And medical school does a really nice job at introducing you to several different fields so that hopefully the field that you go into you click with at some point.  And that did occur, that did occur with me.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Because I'm an internist.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And an internist is someone who treats anybody from age 18 to 118.  But internists are very detailed with every organ system of the body.  And so when I was going through those rotations as a medical student, for me, I was in heaven.  Because I'm a very detailed person.  I like to know every time point, and I like to kind of be like a Sherlock Holmes.  Someone comes in the hospital and I've got to figure out why they are sick, how they got sick, and what do they have?  And so it's one big detective story from start to finish.  So I enjoy doing that.  And internists also are kind of like a gatekeeper.  You know, they are in charge of the primary care for a lot of their patients, whether it's high blood pressure, diabetes, they're very personal with their patients.  They spend a lot of time with them, and that's what I enjoy.    Host: Because it's so broad, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Very broad.    Host: You need to understand, like you said, everything inside the body.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.  Absolutely.    Host: So we did a podcast episode earlier -- I can't remember the episode title, but it was with Natasha Cho, another flight surgeon.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I know her well.    Host: Yeah.  And she was talking about how different specialties in medicine, you kind of -- it's almost like they have certain personalities.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: They do.    Host: And she's emergency medicine.  So she has certain -- so internists have this more detailed approach, I guess.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Detailed approach.  Some people say anal, but, you know, I take it as a compliment because what I tell -- I teach a lot of students, interns, and residents.  And what I tell them is as an internist you know the most about your patient in the hospital better than anyone -- better than the surgeon you consult, better than the cardiologist you asked to come see, better than anybody else.  You have to know everything about your patient.  Because you are their primary, their primary care physician.  And you tie all those pieces together for them.  So when they make all their visits to the different specialists and come back to you, you say, \"Okay, let's look at the integrated story.\"  And you're able to explain it to them and spend time with them.    Host: See, that's I think one of the main differences, especially with Natasha.  Coming from emergency med it's more like what's the problem, identify the problem -- you've got this short-term relationship.  Whereas an internist, you're talking about a long-term, lasting relationship.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So Natasha sees them, says, \"You need to be in the hospital, Serena, here you go.\"     [ Laughter ]  And I take over from there.    Host: I see.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So yeah, absolutely.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: She's fantastic, I love Natasha.    Host: Oh, yeah.  It was a great interview, honestly.  So this pre-medicine, where did you identify -- so you identified that you need -- you're like, \"Okay, internist, that's what I want to be.\"  So what was the next step for you?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So the next step was applying to medical school, which was not as easy as you think.  I did not get many interviews.    Host: Oh.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It was very -- and so I would -- for anybody who's out there in undergraduate applying for med school, it's not that my grades weren't good.  They were good.  It's just you're applying and the competition's very stiff.  So I think I got -- and I was living in the state of Texas.  I had residency in the state of Texas, thank goodness, at that time because we have a lot of the great medical schools.  And so I had a lot of the places I got to interview -- or got to apply to.  Got interviews at two, got waitlisted at both institutions.  So I actually got in very late to medical school.  And it's because someone took a chance on me.  And I remember the interview.  And it was at UT Houston, which is now McGovern Medical School.  And I remember interviewing.  And they said -- they looked at my application and said, \"NASA?  What do you want to do with NASA?\"  I said, \"I have no idea, but I want to work for NASA after I finish going to medical school.\"  And I remember he said, \"Huh, that's interesting.\"  And at the time also, coming into medical school very few engineers were premed.  Majority of folks were biology majors or chemistry majors.   But engineering was rare.  So, again, he looked at my application and said, \"Engineering?  How are you going to tie that in?\"  And I said, \"Well, I want to work for NASA.  And I think these two fields blend beautifully.\"  And so someone took a chance on me.  And it worked out beautifully.  But I got in very late, probably April prior to starting that fall.  So you know?  And rest is kind of history.  But I tell folks it's okay if you don't get in the first time or maybe you're not their first choice.  I wasn't somebody's first choice obviously, but it works out.    Host: Wow.  So you said you put NASA on your resume.  And do you think that was kind of a chance, like, a bold move, or was it -- I guess it sounded like it was a curious thing for that person to look at that?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I think so.  I think in a way I wanted to be truthful with what I wanted to do and not -- but I also knew it would help my application stick out a little bit in that yeah, I am different than most folks coming in.  Because where I see my future path, where I see myself employed maybe isn't in a normal private practice or in a hospital.  It's in the space program.  And so it's -- you know, but he could tell that that's what I was excited about, that's what I was passionate about.  You know, at that point I'd begun to learn what a flight surgeon was, and I just thought it was the coolest thing ever.  And I didn't know much about how they trained or how they got there, but for some reason that clicked for me.    Host: And I'm guessing they offered something -- the school offered something where it's just like, \"Yes, that's going to help me get into NASA.\"    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah.  And so what happened was I was a fourth-year medical student.  And people were beginning to sign up for all of these electives on the outside because they do give you that opportunity to go do one-month rotations outside of the school.  And I said, \"Okay, well, how do I do this?  What does NASA have?\"  So I literally just Googled NASA, medicine, couple other search terms, and up popped a flight surgeon's phone number.  And a flight surgeon that still works for NASA, Phil Stepaniak.  He's fantastic.  And I remember dialing his phone number.  And the first time he picked up the phone and said hello, I hung up right away.  I was like, \"I don't want to talk to this guy [Laughs].\"  And then the people who know Phil know he's just fantastic.  But I dialed back again and I said, \"Hey, my name is Serena.  I read about these programs.  I don't know how to get there.  Can I come work with you?  Can I see what your work is all about, what you do on a daily basis?\"  And he goes, \"I tell you what.  There's a program we have down here, it's offered twice a year.  It's an aerospace medicine clerkship built for medical students.\"   And he gave me all the contact information, and that's how I found out about it.  So it wasn't because it was advertised or widely known.  In general, aerospace medicine is not a field that's widely advertised.  It's usually found by folks who want to find it.  And so that's how I got involved.  So I did that rotation.  It was an in October.  Interviews for residency were about to start.  And I learned about a special program that UTMB in Galveston had and changed all my applications around at the last second.    Host: Wow.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And applied for a very special aerospace medicine, internal medicine residency.    Host: That's kind of bold.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It was very bold [Laughs].  And I remember -- I actually remember where I was driving down the highway, sweating a little bit thinking, \"Oh my gosh, should I do this?  Should I change all my applications around, ask my advisors for new letters of recommendation to go in a program that takes one person a year?\"  Sure [Laughs].  You know?    Host: But it has to do with the fact that NASA was always part of the plan.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.    Host: And this goes back to -- does it go back to your childhood when the inspiration for NASA first came and kind of pushed you?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, I just remember watching shuttles launch third, fourth, fifth grade.    Host: Oh, wow.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Very distinctly remember Challenger in the fifth grade.  I remember where I was sitting in the classroom.  I remember being a little miffed because our fifth-grade science teacher would not let us watch the launch.  We actually had to sit in class and listen to lecture.  And then I distinctly remember another teacher running in and saying that the shuttle had exploded.  And so it was very -- I just remember that the next few months I just watched as much as I could over and again on the television about the disaster and the investigation.  And it just -- it very much humanized the space program for me because it showed the faces of the crew and their families.  And you realized how personal the space program is to America and how much America loves, trusts, and depends on the space program.  It's part of our existence, it's part of who we are to explore.  And then thinking even at that young age, you know, how does NASA move on from this?  How do we launch another Shuttle again?  And we did.  So it was really amazing and profound even for a ten-year-old at that time.    Host: Oh, ten.  So it was around this time where you kind of had the sense that this is -- this is something -- maybe it's this community, this humanization that really sort of said, \"Maybe that's a family that I want to be a part of.\"    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I just saw myself being a part of that family.  And call it your gut, call it your instinct, you know, for me that's what resonated.  And I still use that with a lot of folks I teach today, and I say follow your instinct.  Because if something tells you something's not right or doesn't feel right, you're right.  You know?  If something tells you, you should be a part of this or a part of something, you're right.  So I've tried to use that as kind of a guiding force as well.    Host: Now, fast forward and you're on the fast track to this -- this flight surgeon program, the one that only takes a few people, one person.  And now you're on your way to start getting to NASA.  So where was that transition, from where did you start?  Where did you get there?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So I trained for two years in the special -- so I completed, you know, an internal medicine residency and then aerospace medicine after that and then immediately went to work as a flight surgeon for NASA.  And, again, a flight surgeon is somebody, who, when they're working for NASA, looks after the astronauts and their families.  And one of my first assignments was to go to Star City, Russia and be the flight surgeon or physician kind of on call for out astronauts in training.  So for me, it was number one I'd never been to Russia before, totally brand new world.  Never worked with so many astronauts before in close proximity and been the only physician out there, which was a little bit daunting because you're kind of on your own out there in Star City as the sole American physician.  You are in charge.  And so it was tremendous responsibility for a very young flight surgeon, but I loved it.  I got to spend a lot of time with astronauts in the program who are still in the program today and I consider to be very close friends, to learn what their life was like, to learn what their training was like and say, \"Is this something I can see myself doing?   Is this where I think I'd like to go?  Is this -- can I see myself in their shoes?\"  So.    Host: So was astronaut a part of the plan or was just being at NASA a part of the plan?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Astronaut was definitely part of the plan, even from an early on age.  So I knew, you know, hey, I'd love to be an astronaut.  But it was kind of like one step at a time.    Host: Yep.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: You know, hey, let's get to NASA.  Let's see -- and it's very interesting.  When you take the path that I have and I was able to realize my dream and become an astronaut, I also realized that all the stuff I did leading up to that I absolutely love.  I absolutely love being a physician.  It is something that I feel like I should have been all along, no matter what.  I love seeing patients.  I love treating patients.  I love the field of medicine.  So to me it was surprising, you know, kind of what you learn along the way -- learn what you love and what you're good at.    Host: Another piece of advice that I consistently hear from astronauts is, you know, there's a lot of different paths you can take to become an astronaut, right?  Yours was more of the medical route.  I've talk to test pilots and geologists and everything, but what it comes down to is along the way are you happy at each step?  If you were -- for whatever reason, this was where you were going to end up forever, would you be happy?  And a lot of them said, \"Yes, if I were to stop here, absolutely I'd be happy.  If I just stopped at being a physician, yes, absolutely.  I would enjoy that for the rest of my life.\"  And I think that's pretty important, finding something you're passionate about and just sort of sticking with it.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.  And I get that question a lot from very young students who, when they first ask the question, they say, \"What field do you think NASA would want me to go in?\"  And I say, \"Nuh-uh.  Stop right there.  What field do you want to go into?  What do you love?  Don't pick a field because you think NASA will like it.\"  What NASA, I think, loves about the people that they bring in is the fact that they're so good at what they do and they absolutely love it.  And you can't be really, really good at something unless you absolutely love it.  And so I tell folks I've had even, you know, young medical students say, \"What medicine should I go into?\"  I'm like, \"Whatever you want to do.  If you love dermatology, do dermatology.  If you don't want to be a doctor at all, don't be a doctor.\"  You know?  It's one of these things where I think you're right, all the folks in my office, if for whatever reason we had to leave NASA today and go back to what we were doing, we loved what we were doing.  So not a problem.    Host: You'd be so happy.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.    Host: Now, there's a lot of changes for you along the way, right?  You have this -- first you're going for engineering.  You're like, \"Well, actually internal medicine.\"  And then you're like, \"Actually I'd like to do some aerospace medicine.\"  So there's all these changes.  Now you're in Star City, Russia.  Did you have someone you were shadowing or maybe was this, like, a first-time experience?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No, it was [Laughs] -- you kind of figure it out.  So that when you go out there for your first trip, you have a two-week handover with an experienced flight surgeon, and that was Gene Dow, someone who's been in the military for a long time.  And Gene still does rotations out there in Star City.  But Gene trained me to say, \"These are your roles and responsibilities out there.  These are the unique things, unique aspects of living and working in Star City, certainly in Russia itself, going into Moscow, the different training events.\"  So you get a very quick two-week handover, and then it's you.  And it's really you learn on the job.  And folks who have worked in Russia before know that Russians really value longevity.  So, for example, a lot of the their jobs, you'll find the same person in the same job over all the years to come -- five years, ten years, fifteen years.  Whereas in America we tend to -- there's a lot of turnover in multiple positions.  So someone will work three years here, then four years here.  And so the Russians really value personal relationships and getting to know you.   And I had a lot of trips out there my very first two or three years.  And so in a sense you build up a little bit of street credit with Russians because they say, \"Okay, she's been out here, she understands us, she knows us.\"  So I really enjoyed getting to learn about the Russians, learn about their culture, and make some really good friendships, which I still have today -- certainly with some of the Russian flight docs.  That part was a lot of fun.    Host: That's right.  Now being an astronaut, do you find yourself among the same circles and you, you know, I guess bump into someone in Star City and say hey.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: You know, the neat part was when I got assigned to my expedition and I went for my first training trip out in Russia, the very first day you are there they do a presentation to the Russian commission where you are introduced formally.  Your biography is read.  So all the instructors understand where you come from.  And then you say a few words in Russian.  And it was really nice to see kind of the management stand up and give my background and say, \"Serena, we all know you.  Our medical colleagues are here, they remember you.  Welcome back.\"  And so that part was really nice.  Because you feel like, \"Yeah, these folks do know me.  I've been here a long time.\"    Host: Wow.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So it does buy you some credibility early on.    Host: Very cool.  So what else were you doing when you first got to NASA -- before being selected as an astronaut, what else were you doing?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Well, so I worked, of course, in space medicine.  And so when I wasn't in Russia looking out over astronauts, I was assigned -- I did get the chance to work on STS-127 as a flight surgeon for the Shuttle crew, which I didn't think I'd get a chance to do, but I thought that was really cool.  Because, you know, working Shuttle Ops as compared to Space Station is a very different style.  We still had the two mission controls at that point.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So we had a mission control for Space Station and one for Shuttle.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And I had done most of my training in the Space Station realm, and then they said, \"Hey, you are going to be the deputy flight surgeon for this Shuttle mission.  Get to know the crew, you're flying out to Florida.  You're taking part of TCDT,\" and all these different preparation periods for a Shuttle crew.  So it was a totally different world.  But those friends that I made on the crew are still my really good friends today.  And the really neat part about that was STS-127 had a launch delay of about a month.  So they actually attempted to launch a few times, and then they were scrubbed for a month, and then attempted to launch again.  And in between that month timeframe was when we found out that we were in the astronaut corps.  And so when I came back for the second launch attempt as the flight surgeon, I had already been accepted into the corps.  And so it was neat because those guys and ladies also celebrated that.  And one of the neatest things that happened to me was when that Shuttle crew landed -- so we took up Tim Kopra on the Shuttle crew for his long-duration stay on Space Station and brought down Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata.   And so when we pick up a Shuttle crew, we have the special van that kind of hooks into the orbiter, and then we pull out the crew.  And then we do all of our medical checks and everything.  And I remember standing there and Koichi Wakata was the second or third person to come out of the orbiter.  And he comes through the hatch and he see me and he goes, \"Congratulations, you're going to love it.\"  And I think this guy just landed, you know, on Endeavor and he looked at me and said -- and he congratulated me.  I just thoughts that was one of the most selfless things that anybody could ever do.    Host: That's right.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And it was just neat.  And I don't know if he remembers that, but I remember that.    Host: Wow.  That's right.  Because you can absolutely take that as your moment if you're landing, but he took the time to congratulate you.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yep.    Host: That's amazing.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And most of them did when they walked off the orbiter.  It was just a neat thing.  I think Chris Cassidy was eating M&M's as he walked off and said congratulations.    Host: So they made the announcement.  So it was public at this time, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It was public.    Host: So everybody knew.  What about when you got the call and had to keep it a secret for a little bit?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: When I got the call, you know, initially they said, \"Hey, you can tell your close family members.\"  So I did, and they were very excited.  And I just remember I was sitting outside of a restaurant, waiting to go to lunch with a friend in my car when I got that call.    Host: Oh.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And so, you know, the rumor was depending on who called you, you could tell whether or not you were in or not.  So if you got a call from the chief of the office, generally it meant you were in.  If you did not get a call from the chief of the office, then that meant you did not get in.  So I remember receiving the phone call and I picked it up and said hello.  And they said, \"Hello, is this Serena?\"  And I said, \"Yes it is.  Who is this?\"  so I knew.  And it was Peggy Whitson and Steve Lindsey.  And so I knew at that point, you know, that I had gotten in.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was neat.    Host: So you had to kind of maintain during lunch.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yep, yep.  And then call my family.  So.    Host: Oh, of course.  Of course.  So all of this is happening all at the same time.  You're deputy crew surgeon, you understand that you're an astronaut.  So I want to go back to the deputy crew surgeon, though, because you said you got to work really closely and develop a relationship with the crew members.  What does a deputy crew surgeon do for the Shuttle?  It sounds like you're with them or a while.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: You're with them for a while through a lot of their training events.  Generally what the lead and the deputy crew surgeon do is we kind of split up the crews as far as individual medical exams.  So, for example, like, I was in charge of Doug Hurley, I was in charge of Chris Cassidy.  And so, you know, you get to know those guys really well.  And I had known Doug Hurley for some time because he worked out in Russia with me for a while in Star City.  And so it was really kind of neat to work with him out there and then to become his deputy crew surgeon on his Shuttle mission.  It was really exciting.  And so you go to a lot of their training events.  As they prep for launch and fly out to the Cape -- Cape Canaveral in Florida -- you often go out there with them.  You get to know their families really well because you're with their families quite a bit during the pre-launch timeframe, during launch, and certainly after landing.  So it's a very personal job.  The flight surgeon, you know, it's a lot of preparation up front to make sure everybody's ready to go.  And then you are there to provide whatever support is needed.  And a lot of times that support's not medical, it may just be emotional.   It may be, \"Hey, let me help you get lunch today.  Let me help you fix lunch for your kids,\" you know?  It's a lot of that sort of stuff.    Host: That's where the skills that you were talking about earlier come into play.  When your friends were saying, \"Hey, you should go into medicine.  You're really good with people.\"  So not only do you know medicine, but the whole job kind of I guess you could say demands that you have a relationship with the crew.  Because you're with them for so much, you can't hate each other.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: You are, you are.  And what I used to tell folks coming out to work as a flight surgeon in Star City is less than 10% to 15% of what you do is medical; the rest is just more emotional support, just supporting in whatever, meaning you're making dinner tonight.  Or if someone is trying to fix a TV in one of the cottages, you help them fix the TV.  Or it's little things, it's absolute little things.  I mean, you're there, your calm presence is there, you know, in case -- knock on wood -- anything does happen.  But a lot of it's just being there as a friend, really.    Host: So was this job, helping out the crew of STS-127, was that the last thing you did as a non-astronaut?  Did the transition happen pretty quickly after that?  Or were there a couple things?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It was.  In fact, I was afraid if we scrubbed any longer, I wouldn't be able to take part in the mission.  And I can't remember what the start date was.  I want to say it was August 20th or so.  And, you know, STS-127 launched in July, if I remember correctly.    Host: They landed at the end of July.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Landed at the end of July.  So I didn't have -- I had essentially two or three weeks post-landing before I entered the corps.  And so there's a lot of work that goes on post landing, too -- reaction, debriefs, everything.  And I basically took part in two weeks in that and I said, \"I need a week off before I start my new job, I'm out.\"  And so [Laughs].    Host: Well, yeah, you're about to go on a --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, and they all understood.  So I was just really thankful that we did launch that second, you know, attempt, that second period and I was able to take part.    Host: Right.  Because I guess it was pretty -- as soon as you walked in the door as an astronaut day one, you hit road.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, you almost immediately hit the road trying to -- yeah.    [00:28:40] Host: Wow.  So what were some of the things you were doing?  You did a couple really unique things.  You lived under water, you went to Antarctica, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, I had a lot of really cool experiences the first -- I mean, the whole time has been a cool experience -- but certainly the first three or four years that I was in the corps.  In 2010, you know, so I had really been in the corps a little over a year when Peggy Whitson -- I remember I was on an elliptical machine in the gym and she comes up to me and goes, \"Hey, do you want to go to Antarctica?\"  [Laughs] And I remember saying sure.  And so soon, very quickly I was on my way, prepping to go on this meteorite-hunting expedition for two months by the South Pole.  I mean, it was one of the most remote locations on the planet.  And just trying to prep for an experience like that and learn how to live in an extreme environment in an tent on the ice for two months, I mean, it's amazing.    Host: So that was kind of the purpose of it, right, is to understand about living in an extreme environment but also the added benefit of maybe hunting for meteorites?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Well, the purpose of the mission -- so the mission was run out of Case Western University.  And their purpose is finding meteorites.  The purpose is the science; the astronaut office says, \"Hey, we can provide a great worker to find meteorites because we think this is good as a good analog to Space Station.  We think that living here itself benefits us more.  And so we're perfectly willing to send you an astronaut to help take part in this expedition to find meteorites at the South Pole.  These are our side benefits that we see.\"  Because if you asked other people, a lot of the other scientists that were out there, their main goal was not -- I mean, it was neat that they were living in an extreme environment, but they didn't see how that would relate to Station.  We do, though.  And you do learn about a lot about yourself living in an environment like that -- very isolated, away from family, barely connect.  I mean, you can connect through a sat phone, but you certainly didn't have any Internet or anything like that.  I mean, you're much better connected on the Space Station than you are in Antarctica.  So and it was just learning what we call good self-care and good team-care.   And those are two very important expeditionary skills.  And what I mean by that is self-care meaning recognizing signs of fatigue in yourself, recognizing when maybe you're not 100% for whatever reason -- you're hungry, your cold, you're tired, you're irritable.  Why?  You know?  Can you pick up on those things early and talk with your team and say, \"Look, I am not 100% today.  Maybe these are the reasons.\"  And then team care, that's recognizing those signs in your teammates and saying, \"Wow, so and so looks really cold today.\"  And we would use that.  One of us would look really cold after a day of searching for meteorites.  And so when we'd get back to our campsite, we'd say, \"Hey, so and so, go in the tent and start the fire.  We'll take of fueling up the snowmobiles.  We'll stay outside a little longer.\"  You know?  And so it's recognizing that stuff not only in yourself but in your team to make sure you pick up on things early.    Host: So you walked away with the benefit of maybe a more introspective look at --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.    Host: -- at saying this is me.  And interpersonal, understanding your crew mates.  But most importantly in the isolated environment, in this --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Exactly.    Host: -- in this unique environment.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And that's the same thing we learn about with Nemo.  Nemo is just -- it's not at the South Pole, but it is under the sea.  You are isolated.  You don't just swim up to the surface anytime you want because you're fully saturated.  You know, your food selection is very limited because you're eating mostly freeze-dried things.  Very similar to Station, although Station's menu is much larger than what we had on Nemo.  But it's, again, learning what's important to you in those environments and what things you have to protect against -- fatigue, stress level.  How important is talking to family?  Is it every day what you need, is it every other day, you know?  And Station provides all that for you, but it's learning how you work and how to make sure you pace yourself at a good tempo so you don't get too tired so that you maintain over the long haul.    Host: Ah, so you're literally learning how to have these skills and basically just kind of transfer it to Space Station?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely, yeah.    Host: Wow.  So I kind of want it -- I mean, I'm sure you have a lot of training, and we've talked about training with a lot of the astronauts so far.  But what's unique about you as a physician is you have a sort of unique perspective of doing research on the human body on the station.  So I'm sure that's kind of -- you have a different perspective than maybe most.  You know, you have -- as an astronaut you're sort of a subject for a lot of these experiments.  But you are the subject, but also here I guess you're curious from the physician point of view, too.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah.  I mean, so used to being the physician that treats the patient.  And when you get up to Space Station, you are the patient.  You are the science experiment.  You are the one that everybody is observing, and looking at, and asking questions, and poking and prodding, and asking for samples [Laughs].  And I'm happy to give those.  But, you know, I think just from a physician's mind because I've studied these phenomena for so long, you still think, \"Well, how would I be?  Would be that -- would my face be that puffy when I get up there?  Will I feel sick to my stomach?  If I do, how long will that last?  Will I have a headache?  How will I tolerate CO2?\"  You know, you think about all these things and you just learn.  Because the human body is so widely variable amongst people, everybody's different.  The neater part about the body and what I -- the term I like to use when I talk with folks is I don't think we give the body enough credit.  The body is remarkably adaptable, remarkably dynamic.  Pretty much you can put us in any situation -- low-level insult meaning low-levels of radiation, increased levels of carbon dioxide as compared to where we live here, microgravity -- and the body learns to live there.   It learns how to adapt and eventually everything settles out and you feel somewhat normal for that environment.  So I'm curious to see how long it will take me to get to that point, you know, and how I'll live and function up there.  Those are my biggest questions.  I'm really looking forward to that.    Host: Wow, it's unique.  Because it's not just -- I guess obviously if you're an astronaut, you would be curious to say, \"Oh man, when am I going to feel better?\"     [ Laughter ]    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I hope I don't feel this bad for long.  But it's inevitable.  I mean, space adaptation syndrome -- 80% to 90% of folks get it, especially first-time fliers.    Host: What's that, space adaptation syndrome?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: So space adaptation syndrome is a syndrome that folks get within the first few days, usually almost immediately upon going into orbit.  And the symptoms can be anything from low-level nausea, maybe even vomiting, headache, again, feeling very puffy in the face because of that massive fluid shift that occurs.  And so it's just a combination of a lot of things that -- I think it's that sudden shift into low-earth orbit where you body goes, \"Oh my goodness, what did you just do?  You are not going to feel good until we figure this out [Laughs], you know?  I don't care what you think is going on here, but you're going to feel a little nauseas for a little bit of time.\"  So it's -- you know, but everybody gets it to varying degrees.  And folks who have flown before don't get it as severe.  Why is that?  I think the body remembers.  The body adapts.  It's just -- we say the brain is plastic.  And people say what does that mean, plastic?  Plasticity means the brain adapts and reforms neurons and reshapes neural connections and networks based on the input.   So when you lose your gravitational cues, when gravity's no longer there and your middle ear doesn't know if you're pitching your head forward or turning to the right, it adapts.  And it figures out a new reality.  And when you lay back on the ground, it goes, \"Oh my goodness, what did you just do?  Okay, I think I remember -- I think this is gravity.  Let me reshape those networks again and go back to where we used to be.\"  So, again, we don't give the body enough credit.  It is amazing how it can adapt.    Host: See, when you say it like that, almost personifying the body as, like, \"Whoa, what are you doing to me?\"  But then, like you said, it figures it out.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It figures it out.    Host: It finds a way.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: That's right.    Host: And I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's the inner ear part.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah.    Host: Up, down -- I mean, where is up and down?  What the ear does is it shuts off, right?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Well, basically the semicircular canals, everything that -- that measures tilt and acceleration, a lot of those are gravitational cues.  Your hear cells in the ear, all that is gravitational.  When you don't have gravity, suddenly it goes, \"Huh, how do I -- which way is up, which way is down?\"  Well, there is no up, there is no down.  And so it just reshapes and you train it to live without gravity.  And you train it so that if you are standing straight up or if you suddenly flip, still the same.  You can't do that down here.  And so, again, it's just remarkably adaptable.    Host: That's right.  I'll never forget a video when Tim Kopra was up for his -- for the most recent long-duration, he was there with Tim Peake, and they did this weird experiment where Kopra pretty much just spun Tim Peake as fast as he could doing rapid front flips.  But Tim Peake didn't really get nauseous or anything.  When he stopped suddenly, he felt something real quick.  But other than that, his body was completely fine.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yep.    Host: It was so weird.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah.    Host: And then to your point of the body remembers, I'll never forget when Jeff Williams came up for the most recent time and I saw him get out of the hatch.  And I saw another camera, one of the six pack cameras in mission control and he just was flying around the corner, just --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Like normal.    Host: -- like normal.  Like, \"All right, I'm back.  Time to go.\"  Didn't get sick at all.  Just ready to go.  It was just amazing to see because you know that they're going to be sick or feel weird.  Sometimes they come in upside down and don't know which way is --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Very disoriented, yeah.    Host: But Jeff Williams had no problem.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Nope, his body remembered.  His brain remembered.  I fully expect Alex to be the same way.  You know, Alex has flown before.  And my Russian commander in the Soyuz, Serge [inaudible], you know, we're both rookies.  And so I think, you know, now our journey to Space Station is two days long.  We have a 34-orbit rendezvous.  So we'll be in the capsule for a while.  And that will give us a little bit of time to adjust.    Host: Okay.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: But once we open that hatch into the larger volume of station, people say you get a little disoriented again because now what's up, what's down, left, right?  You know, everything's different, So.    Host: Do they tell you whenever you go to the hatch of the Soyuz just, like, \"By the way, this is going to be the ceiling.\"    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No.    Host: So you don't know?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No.  You figure it out.  Because the thing is when you see people when you first come into station, they could be oriented -- one person could be upside down and one person --    Host: Oh, so they purposely throw you off?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: No, I think it's just natural for them.    Host: Oh, I see.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: They don't think about it.    Host: That's right.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: It's whatever's comfortable.  Because you can work in 3D.    Host: Yeah.  It will be interesting to see -- I'm curious to see how you're going to look at it from a flight surgeon's perspective.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Absolutely.  Me, too.    Host: Have you talked with other flight surgeons who have flown like Chel [assumed spelling] or --    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I have, I have.  And you get different experience from both.  And Mike Barrett especially is really good at explaining sort of these adaptation periods where you first get there and when you first get on Space Station, I mean, you will hold onto a handrail for dear life.  Because you don't know how else to control yourself.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: And you just -- and he shows pictures of himself very first couple days on station just holding onto everything with all this strength.  Because he felt he needed to do that.  And then after a period of time you realize just a slight toe tap, a slight touch and you can shift position and you can stabilize yourself.  And you can go around a corner gracefully and not look like, you know, an acrobat that's fallen down.  So he talks about these periods of adaptation until you reach this deep adaptation where your body just feels like it belongs there to a degree and you don't have to think twice about performing actions, or turning a corner, or where your head is positioned relative to your feet.  It's not even something that even crosses your mind.    Host: So are you absorbing all of these trips?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I try, yes [Laughs].  But I think the other one that I remember, too, is Mike Hopkins.  Because I asked him, I said, \"Hey, once you guys made it into orbit on the Soyuz, what do you feel like?\"  And he goes, \"I felt like I was hanging from the ceiling.\"  And it's called an inversion illusion.  And he says, \"I literally felt like my feet were on the ceiling and I was hanging upside down.\"  And I've had a couple people say that.  And they're not physically, but their brain is perceiving that.  And my only guess is that because the fluid has started to shift upwards.  And Kate Rubins also said it feels like you're hanging off the edge of your bed with your head down.  And so is that where that's coming from?  I don't know.  So it's going to be fascinating.    Host: Yeah.  I mean, I'm trying to think -- I'm trying to imagine myself.  I mean, I'll never go to the Space Station.  But I'm trying to imagine myself in this situation.  And I can see, like you're saying, your body just trying to figure out what's up and down.  I mean, if you're hanging upside down and you're looking, you understand, \"Okay, I'm upside down.\"  Maybe it's a little bit because of the gravity, but your sight, you know, you know that -- so if you have no way of telling if you're upside down or not, I imagine your vision just doing this [inaudible].    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Yeah, I think you just have to get used to it and just very quick the body adapts, it learns.    Host: I'm getting dizzy just trying to think about it.  [Laughs] Well, going up on your increment, anything that you're sort of look forward to, maybe a particular experiment or maybe some operations that are coming up on yours?    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: I think, again, human science is one of the biggest things I'm looking forward to going up on station.  And, again, we're hitting all parts of the body.  There's experiments called fluid shifts, there are experiments called neuromapping.  You know, we're looking at how the brain reacts being in low-earth orbit, being in microgravity.  And then, again, with fluid shifts, looking at how the vessels change, your blood vessels change in microgravity.  How does that impact the eyes?  Because we do tend to see changes in the eyes of astronauts as they live on board a Space Station.  And for some astronauts, that means that they can't read as well as they did before when they were on earth's surface.  It's harder for them to read procedures.  They become what we call a little more presbyopic, which means their close vision is not as good as it was.  And so we think that there are a number of factors as to why this happens, but a good portion of it is the way fluid is shifting and moving in the body and maybe impacting the eyeball itself.  So I'm most interested in looking at the changes and all the experiments that are done on us, on people.   That bad said, there's a lot of engineering stuff that's going to be going on as well.  We're going to be testing some new carbon dioxide removal systems onboard station.  We're going to be changing out this really big panel inside our airlock.  It's called the UIA.  And the UIA panel is the panel that our two space walkers interact with prior to going outside on a space walk.  That's a big deal when we change out something that big for space walks.  So we'll be working on that.  Hopefully we're going to see a lot of visiting vehicles, SpaceX Dragon capsules and Japanese HTV vehicles.  So it's -- I'd love to see probably an unmanned commercial crew vehicle.  Don't know if that will happen, but I will keep my fingers crossed.    Host: Wow.  A lot of great stuff coming up for you.  And a lot of training until you get to there.  So I guess, Serena, thank you so much for coming on.  The best of luck on the rest of your training.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Thank you very much.    Host: The best of luck on your mission.  Thank you so much.    Serena Aunon-Chancellor: Thank you very much.  Glad to be here.     [ Music ]    Houston, go ahead.     [Inaudible] of the Space Shuttle.    Roger, zero G and I feel fine.    Shuttle has cleared the [inaudible].    We came in peace for all mankind.    It's actually a huge honor to break a record like this.    Not because they are easy but because they are hard.   [Inaudible] Houston, welcome to space.    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Serena Aunon-Chancellor.  She's going to be going to the International Space Station here in a few weeks.  So you can follow her on her social media account.  She's on Twitter at @AstroSerena.  And she'll be sharing some pictures and some stories from her time aboard the International Space Station.  You can also go to NASA.gov/ISS to get the latest and greatest on things going on aboard the International Space Station but also how you can watch her launch live.  We'll also be streaming it on social media, especially Facebook, but I think it will be on Twitter.  No, not Instagram.  But anyway, you can follow us on any one of those platforms -- Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, the International Space Station accounts there.  Otherwise you can listen to our stories going on across the center -- or actually across the agency -- and other NASA podcasts.  So there's Gravity Assist hosted by Dr. Jim Green up at NASA headquarters and then NASA in Silicon Valley tells stories of different scientists and engineers and some of the cool stuff they're doing over at the Ames Research Center in California.  But if you go to social media on our accounts, on the International Space Station accounts, you can use the hashtag #AskNASA on your favorite platform, whichever one you want, to submit an idea or maybe you have a question for the show.   And just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we'll see if we can answer it or maybe dedicate an entire episode to it.  So this episode was recorded on March 9th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, John Stole, Pat Ryan, John Streeter, Brandy Dean, and Kelly Humphries.  And thanks again to Dr. Serena Aunon-Chancellor for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week.",

I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR CO-HOST TODAY, ALONG WITH MEGAN SUMNER, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE. MEGAN, HOW YOU DOING? >> I’M DOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU, GARY? >> DOING GREAT. SO MEGAN, TODAY’S EPISODE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, BECAUSE WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH FOUR-- THAT’S RIGHT, FOUR-- ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE. WE TALKED WITH RANDY “KOMRADE” BRESNIK, JOE ACABA, MARK “SABOT” VANDE HEI, AND PAOLO NESPOLI. ALL OF THEM ARE ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR EXPEDITION 53, WHICH STARTED BACK IN SEPTEMBER AFTER PEGGY WHITSON, JACK FISCHER, AND FYODOR YURCHIKHIN DEPARTED THE STATION. KOMRADE AND NESPOLI WERE ALREADY UP THERE, AND THEY WERE LATER JOINED BY ACABA AND SABOT, AS WELL AS ALEXANDER MISURKIN. >> THAT’S RIGHT, AND WE TALKED TO ALL FOUR OF THEM LIVE, SO WE BROUGHT IN SOME SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTIONS REAL TIME FOR THE ASTRONAUTS TO ANSWER. >> YES, THANKS TO YOU. WE TALKED ABOUT ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY, FOR THE MOST PART-- HOW THEY TAKE PICTURES OF EARTH, AND WHAT THEY SEE, AND THE SORT OF EMOTIONS THAT THAT VIEW BRINGS UP. BUT WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SPACEWALKS GOING ON THIS MONTH, AND EDUCATION IN SPACE, AS WELL AS LIFE IN SPACE. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHTSPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH THE EXPEDITION 53 CREW. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> HELLO NASA TV, FACEBOOK LIVE, USTREAM-- WHEREVER YOU ARE WATCHING. WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” SO IF YOU’RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PODCAST, THIS IS WHERE WE BRING IN NASA EXPERTS-- SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- ALL TO TELL YOU THE COOLEST STUFF ABOUT WHAT’S GOING ON HERE AT NASA. SO TODAY WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE. OF COURSE, YOU CAN SEE US ON CAMERA, AND THIS IS USUALLY AN AUDIO PODCAST. BUT ALSO, WE’RE GOING TO BE TALKING TO SPACE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE’VE DONE THAT. WE’VE DONE IT ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO WITH JACK FISCHER ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND WE’RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN WITH SOME ASTRONAUTS, EXCEPT NOT WITH JUST ONE. WE’RE GOING TO DO IT WITH FOUR ASTRONAUTS: RANDY “KOMRADE” BRESNIK, MARK “SABOT” VANDE HEI, JOE ACABA, AND PAOLO NESPOLI. SO I’M NOT GOING TO DO THIS ALONE, OF COURSE. SAME AS ALWAYS, SAME AS BEFORE, I HAVE A CO-HOST WITH ME-- NASA PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE, MEGAN SUMNER. MEGAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANKS, HAPPY TO BE HERE. EXCITED TO TALK TO THEM. >> AWESOME. SO, I MEAN, PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE. NOT THE ONLY ROLE YOU’VE HAD HERE AT NASA, RIGHT? >> MM-HMM, YEAH. I’VE PREVIOUSLY ACTUALLY MANAGED OUR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HERE-- THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER ACCOUNTS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ACCOUNTS, AND NOW I AM WORKING SUPPORTING THE ASTRO OFFICE FOR APPEARANCES THAT THEY GO OUT AND DO, AND ALSO THE MEDIA SUPPORT. WE HAVE MEDIA COME AND TALK TO THEM BEFORE THEIR MISSIONS, AND DO INTERVIEWS AND MEDIA VISITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. >> FANTASTIC. AND SO, I THINK THAT’S THE REASON YOU’RE THE PERFECT PERSON TO HAVE AS A CO-HOST WITH ME TODAY IS JUST BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW THE ASTRONAUTS THAT WE’RE TALKING TO TODAY. YOU’VE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE PAST, RIGHT? >> YEAH, SO JOE AND MARK, WHO WE’LL BE TALKING TO TODAY, WERE ACTUALLY THE FIRST TWO ASTRONAUTS THAT I GOT TO WORK WITH IN THIS ROLE AS THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER FOR THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE, SO I’M REALLY EXCITED TO GET TO ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM IN SPACE. >> AWESOME. BUT THEN ALSO, YOU RAN THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS HERE AT THE JOHNSON SPACE CENTER FOR A WHILE, SO THAT’S ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS WE ARE ON FACEBOOK LIVE SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU’D LIKE TO SEND UP TO THE CREW, MEGAN IS GOING TO BE MONITORING THOSE QUESTIONS REAL TIME. SHE’S GOT HER PHONE RIGHT NEXT TO HER AND WE’LL BE ASKING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS TODAY. SO THE TOPIC OF TODAY’S CONVERSATION IS ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY. SO WHAT’S THAT ALL ABOUT? >> OH, MAN, THE ASTRONAUTS TAKE THE MOST AMAZING PICTURES FROM THE SPACE STATION AND IT'S JUST AN AMAZING VIEW THAT MOST OF US WILL NEVER GET TO SEE IN OUR LIFETIME. AND THANKFULLY, THEY ARE WILLING TO SHARE THAT VIEW WITH US THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. EASILY THEY CAN SHARE IT OUT TO THE WHOLE WORLD OF WHAT THAT’S LIKE. AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY’RE SHARING WITH US WHAT THEY’RE DOING IN SPACE AND A LITTLE GLIMPSE INTO THEIR LIFE, THE SCIENCE THEY’RE DOING, ALL THE WORK THEY’RE DOING ON BOARD. SO IT’S SO COOL TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT PERSPECTIVE. >> ABSOLUTELY. I’M VERY EXCITED FOR THIS TOPIC BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE MORE VISUAL THINGS THAT WE GET TO SEE OF WHAT THE ASTRONAUTS DO ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. OBVIOUSLY, THEY’RE DOING SCIENCE ALL THE TIME AND WE HAVE CREW MEMBERS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS. AND JUST RECENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT AND DOING A FEW SPACEWALKS SO THEY HAVE MAINTENANCE TASKS THAT THEY REGULARLY DO. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE’RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY. AND ACTUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO US WE HAVE SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY PRACTICE ON WHENEVER THEY’RE DOING SOME OF THE-- TO ACTUALLY PRACTICE FOR TAKING PHOTOS OF THE EARTH. SO IT LOOKS LIKE OUR ASTRONAUTS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING SET-UP HERE, JUST LIKE THEY DO FOR ANY PUBLIC AFFAIRS EVENT. SO WE’RE GOING TO BE TALKING WITH MISSION CONTROL SOON AND GETTING THAT STARTED. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK THEM BELOW. >> YUP, YUP, WE’RE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS ON FACEBOOK LIVE. I’LL BE WATCHING AND ASKING THE CREW, SO GET YOUR QUESTION IN THERE AND WATCH ALONG SO YOU CAN HEAR IF THEY GET A CHANCE TO ANSWER IT. >> ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT, LOOKS LIKE OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS ARE GETTING SET UP RIGHT NOW. LET’S THINK, I MEAN, SO WE HAVE-- WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITIES THAT THEY’VE BEEN DOING, SOME OF THE SPACEWALKS AS WELL, BUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CREW-- RANDY BRESNIK AND JOE ACABA AND PAOLO NESPOLI HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. FOR MARK VANDE HEI THIS IS HIS FIRST SPACEFLIGHT, SO WE’LL GET TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AS BEING A NEWCOMER. ACTUALLY, THREE OF THE ASTRONAUTS WE’VE TALKED TO ON THE PODCAST BEFORE-- RANDY BRESNIK, MARK VANDE HEI, AND JOE ACABA-- ALL EACH INDIVIDUAL EPISODES TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES OF WHAT THEY’VE DONE ABOARD. PAOLO NESPOLI, THIS’LL BE THE FIRST TIME TALKING WITH HIM, SO THAT’LL BE A PLEASURE AS WELL. AND HE SHARED SOME FANTASTIC IMAGERY OF ITALY AND JUST DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH, SO CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT WE’RE DOING THERE. SO LET’S CONNECT WITH MISSION CONTROL, HOUSTON, AND TALK TO OUR FOUR ASTRONAUTS. AGAIN, SEND YOU QUESTIONS BELOW ON FACEBOOK LIVE. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON. ARE YOU READY FOR THE EVENT? >> HOUSTON, WE’RE READY FOR THE EVENT. >> JSC PAO, PLEASE CALL STATION FOR A VOICE CHECK. >> STATION, THIS IS GARY JORDAN AND MEGAN SUMNER IN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICE. HOW DO YOU HEAR US? >> GARY, WE GOT YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. MEGAN, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU, TOO. >> ALL RIGHT, WELL THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE TALKING TO ALL FOUR OF YOU TODAY. I THOUGHT FOR SURE I’D AT LEAST GET TO TALK TO ONE ASTRONAUT, BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL FOUR OF YOU TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO US TODAY. SO FOR-- A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE PODCAST ALREADY, SO AGAIN, WELCOME BACK. BUT TODAY, WE’RE GOING TO BE DOING A LIVE EVENT SO WE REALLY WANTED TO BRING IN SOME QUESTIONS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND HOPING YOU CAN ANSWER THOSE REAL TIME. BUT JUST TO START OFF, BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUR OF YOU, IF YOU CAN JUST SORT OF GIVE A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO ALL OF YOU SO OUR LISTENERS KIND OF KNOW WHO YOU ARE. >> ALL RIGHT, WE’VE GOT EXPEDITION 53 SPACE STATION COMMANDER RANDY BRESNIK. >> EXPEDITION 52, 53 FLIGHT ENGINEER, PAOLO NESPOLI FROM THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY. >> AND EXPEDITION 53 AND 54 FLIGHT ENGINEER, JOE ACABA. >> EXPEDITION 53 AND 54 FLIGHT ENGINEER, MARK VANDE HEI. >> THAT’S AWESOME. WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. SO WE’LL START WITH KOMRADE AND PAOLO, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN UP THERE THE LONGEST, SO JUST HOW HAVE THE-- HOW’S THE MISSION BEEN GOING SO FAR? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS? >> I THINK CERTAINLY HIGHS FOR US WERE GETTING TO WORK WITH THE PREVIOUS CREW AND THE SPACE NINJA, PEGGY WHITSON, LEARNING FROM THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER AND RUN SPACE STATION WHEN WE HAD OUR NEW CREW SHOW UP FOR EXPEDITION 53. WE GOT TO HAVE A DRAGON COME UP HERE AND BRING A WHOLE BUNCH OF SCIENCE THAT WE GOT TO WORK WITH FOR A WHOLE MONTH. CERTAINLY THE PAST WEEK HAS BEEN REAL EXCITING BECAUSE WE DID TWO EVAs THAT ARE REALLY TURN THE STATION BACK TO GOOD CONFIGURATION WITH A ROBOTIC ARM, AND SOME CAMERA WORK, AND PREPARING STUFF FOR ROBOTIC TASKS IN THE FUTURE. SO WE’VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON INSIDE AND GOING ON OUTSIDE, AND SO IT’S BEEN A REALLY EXCITING EXPEDITION SO FAR AND WE STILL ARE ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH. >> WELL NOT MUCH TO ADD TO KOMRADE HAS ALREADY SAID. I MEAN, WE’RE DOING A LOT OF ACTIVITIES HERE. IT’S ALWAYS CRAZY. LIKE, YOU CAN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, START WORKING WITH SOMETHING, AND SPIN AROUND, AND WORK WITH SOME SCIENCE, AND THEN SPIN AROUND AGAIN, AND WORK WITH THE ROBOTIC ARM. WE’VE BEEN DOING ALMOST ALL OF IT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE, WHAT, 200 MORE ACTIVITIES, 250, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN, AND WE ARE DOING ALL OF THEM. >> FANTASTIC. SO TODAY, I MEAN, I’M SURE THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPICS THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT, BUT REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON ASTRONAUT PHOTOGRAPHY TODAY BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EARTH AND YOU GET SOME TIME SOMETIMES TO GO AND TAKE PHOTOS OF THE EARTH AND MAYBE JUST KIND OF WATCH THE EARTH GO BY. SO I GUESS SINCE, KOMRADE, YOU’RE HOLDING THE MIC, IF YOU WANT TO SHARE SOME EXPERIENCES FROM JUST LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND JUST KIND OF WHAT THAT FEELING IS LIKE? WHAT IT’S LIKE TO WATCH THE EARTH GO BY? >> I MEAN, IT’S REALLY HUMBLING BECAUSE IT’S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING AND THEY’RE SO-- SO FAR, BEEN SO FEW OF US THAT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT. AND YOU DON’T LOOK AT THE EARTH AND COME-- NOT BE CHANGED. YOU CERTAINLY FEEL A PART OF THE EARTH. YOU REALIZE THAT EVERY EXPERIENCES YOU’VE EVER HAD, EVERY PERSON YOU’VE EVER KNOWN IS DOWN ON THAT LITTLE BLUE MARBLE. AND WHEN YOU SEE THE CURVE, YOUR MIND KNOWS HOW BIG THE EARTH IS AND REALIZE WHEN YOU GO AROUND IT IN 90 MINUTES YOU’RE BACK TO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SPOT. AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND SEE THAT YOU JUST FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE IT. I’LL HAND THE MIC OVER TO SABOT OVER HERE BECAUSE HE’S ONLY BEEN UP HERE ABOUT A MONTH, BUT TO GET HIS IMPRESSIONS ON WHAT IT WENT FROM SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO NOW TRANSLATING THAT INTO PHOTOGRAPHY TO TRY AND SHARE THAT WITH OTHERS. >> THE THING THAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST WHEN I FIRST LOOKED OUT THE CUPOLA TO SEE THE EARTH WAS HOW CLOSE THE RECOGNIZABLE FEATURES OF THE EARTH SEEM TO SPACE. FOR EXAMPLE, SEEING ITALY AND IN THE SAME VIEW SEEING THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE. IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE EVERYBODY ON THE EARTH IS REALLY, REALLY CLOSE TO SPACE WITHOUT EVER REALIZING IT. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THERE’S JUST A THIN LAYER OF ATMOSPHERE THAT ALL OF HUMANITY’S LIVING IN AND OUTSIDE OF THAT IS SPACE. SO IT’S IMPRESSIVE TO ME HOW CLOSE WE REALLY ARE ALL TO WHAT WE SEE AS OUTER SPACE. FROM A PHOTOGRAPHY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK THAT’S AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE, SO MY FAVORITE THING TO DO IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE THOSE PICTURES THAT SHOW BOTH THE SPACE AND PLACES THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND CALL HOME ON THE PLANET. >> ABSOLUTELY. AND KOMRADE, I KNOW YOU’VE SHARED SOME JUST THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EARTH COMPARED TO SOME OTHER IMAGES, YOU KNOW, BEING ON THE EARTH, TOO. AND THOSE ARE AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO SEE. BUT I KNOW WE HAVE SOME ACTUAL QUESTIONS COMING IN FROM SOME OF OUR LISTENERS RIGHT NOW. >> YEAH. THAT’S AMAZING. I CAN’T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT’S LIKE TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT VIEW IN PERSON, BUT NEXT BEST THING OF COURSE IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT THROUGH PICTURES AND VIDEOS THAT YOU GUYS ARE TAKING. AND THE WHOLE WORLD REALLY APPRECIATES THAT. WE’VE GOT SOME AWESOME QUESTIONS COMING IN. LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY IN SPACE AND YOU GUYS ON THE SPACE STATION. SO JACE ON FACEBOOK WANTS TO KNOW, “THERE ARE SO MANY CAMERAS ON THE SPACE STATION, HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH CAMERA TO USE? AND CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT YOU DO HAVE UP THERE?” >> YES, SO WE DO HAVE-- FOR STILL PHOTOGRAPHY, WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE A NIKON CAMERA. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE SEVERAL D4. EACH ONE OF US GETS HIS OWN, PLUS WE HAVE A COUPLE PLACED STRATEGICALLY. SOME OF THEM ARE DEDICATED FOR SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHY LIKE MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY. WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY FOR EQUIPMENT HERE. SOME WE JUST DEDICATED TO TAKE-- THERE WAS A MICRO-- A MICRO SHOT, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> TRY ONE WITH A TELE LENS HERE. SOME, LIKE THIS ONE, WE REALLY USE WHEN WE ARE POINTING AT EARTH AND WE HAVE SOME WINDOWS THAT HAVE A SPECIAL CAPABILITY OF LETTING US TAKE PICTURES WITH THIS LENS. AND THEN, WE HAVE-- WE ALSO HAVE A RED DRAGON CAMERA THAT WE USE FOR CINEMATOGRAPHY. WE HAVE VIDEO CAMERAS THAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE HD PHOTOS. I MEAN, I WOULD SAY THAT FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF CAMERAS, LENSES, SET-UP, WE ARE ALL SET HERE. WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. IT’S JUST WHAT IS MISSING A LITTLE BIT IS THE TIME BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO BE THERE AT THE WINDOW. IT’S NOT THAT YOU JUST GO THERE AND YOU CAN TAKE A PICTURE AND LEAVE. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE YOU NEED TO HAVE TO BE THERE AND STAY THERE AND UNDERSTAND-- BECAUSE IT’S A VERY QUICK CHANGING ENVIRONMENT HERE. YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT WE ARE FLYING AROUND EARTH AT ABOUT 4 MILES PER SECOND AND THINGS CHANGE REALLY DRAMATICALLY AND REALLY QUICKLY. AND NOT ONLY THAT, YOU DON’T ALWAYS PASS OVER THE SAME PLACE WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS, ACTUALLY ALMOST NEVER. SO ALL THE CONDITIONS CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY-- THE SUN, THE CLOUD COVERAGE, THE SEASONS. I MEAN, THE COLORS, THE MOON, MAKES A LOT OF CHANGES DURING THE NIGHT. SO IT’S BEEN A QUITE INTERESTING TIME HERE IN TRYING TO TAKE ALL OF THIS ARMADA OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE AND TRY TO MAKE IT DO WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO. NOT ALWAYS HAPPENS, BUT SOMEBODY WILL GET REALLY GREAT, GREAT THINGS SOMETIMES. >> YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE THERE’S A PARTICULAR TECHNIQUE TO TAKE THE ABSOLUTE BEST [PICTURES THAT YOU CAN. AND FROM WHAT YOU’RE SAYING, YOU HAVE TO BE THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN IN ASKING, BUT I’M SURE THE CUPOLA IS JUST A HOT PLACE TO BE ON THE SPACE STATION TO GET THOSE PHOTOS. SO HOW DO YOU SHARE YOUR TIME? AND WHO GETS TO-- TO SEE WHO GETS TO GO IN THE CUPOLA? >> WELL, PAOLO’S THE BIGGEST SO HE ALWAYS GETS THE FIRST-- HE GETS THE FIRST GO. THERE’S A LOT OF TIME IN THE DAY, BUT WE’RE REALLY BUSY AND SO IF SOMEBODY HAS AN INTEREST, THEY KNOW SOMETHING’S COMING UP THEY WANT TO SEE, THEY LET US ALL KNOW AND WE RESPECT THAT AND LET THEM HAVE THAT SPACE. BUT SOMETIMES, THINGS MIGHT COME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO IT’S AT TIMES WE’RE ALL IN THERE BECAUSE SOMETHING IS SO COOL AND WE ALL WANT TO SEE IT. AND SOMETIMES, YOU’RE IN THERE BY YOURSELF JUST ENJOYING IT. AND SOMETIMES, YOU DON’T TAKE PICTURES. I’M NOT THE GREATEST PHOTOGRAPHER SO I JUST ENJOY GOING AND LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW. BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN, WE WRESTLE FOR IT AND-- BUT WE MAKE IT WORK. >> NICE. ALL RIGHT, THIS ONE’S FOR JOE TOO FOR YOU, I HAVE TO ASK FROM FACEBOOK, JESSICA SAYS, “MY FIRST GRADERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR FAVORITE PART ABOUT SPACE IS? JOE WAS MY MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER AND NOW I’M A TEACHER.” THAT’S PRETTY COOL. >> WOW! THAT’S VERY COOL. HELLO, JESSICA. GLAD THAT YOU’RE FOLLOWING US. THERE ARE SO MANY COOL THINGS ABOUT BEING IN SPACE. ONE OF THEM IS, OF COURSE, FLOATING AROUND. THESE GUYS ARE COOL AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE FORM ARE REALLY, REALLY COOL. SO I WOULD SAY BEING ABLE TO DO THIS AND JUST KIND OF HANG OUT IN ANY DIRECTION YOU WANT, YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE A SUPERHERO, SO THAT’S PRETTY COOL. BUT AGAIN, LOOKING BACK AT THE EARTH IS SIMPLY AMAZING. SO JESSICA, I HOPE YOUR FIRST GRADERS GET INSPIRED TO KEEP STUDYING HARD, STUDYING THE STEM FIELDS, AND HOPEFULLY THEY’LL BE DOING MORE THAN WE’RE DOING TODAY ON THE SPACE STATION AND MAYBE THEY’LL BE VISITING OTHER PLANETS. SO THANKS A LOT. >> THANKS, JOE. AND I JUST HAVE TO MENTION, THAT SHE MENTIONED IN THAT COMMENT THAT YOU WERE A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER AND YOU’RE UP THERE. FOLLOWING YOU WE’LL HAVE RICKY ARNOLD, WHO IS ALSO A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER. AND AS PART OF THAT, WE’RE REALLY TALKING A LOT ABOUT EDUCATION AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE SPACE STATION. SO YOU CAN GO LOOK UP STEM ON STATION AND THERE’S A WEBSITE OUT THERE, AND EDUCATORS CAN FIND A LOT OF COOL RESOURCES THERE. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> ALL RIGHT, I GOT ANOTHER QUESTION ON FACEBOOK. THIS IS FROM JACE, “WERE YOU ABLE TO OPERATE PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS BEFORE BECOMING ASTRONAUTS, OR DID YOU LEARN ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY DURING TRAINING? >> I NEVER TOUCHED A PROFESSIONAL CAMERA UNTIL I BECAME AN ASTRONAUT. AND THAT’S BEEN ONE OF THE REALLY NEAT OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT BEING AN ASTRONAUT IS THE-- LIKE THE VERY FANCY CAMERAS LIKE THE RED CAMERA THAT PAOLO MENTIONED. IT’S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF EQUIPMENT AND THE GREAT TRAINERS TO HELP US LEARN HOW TO USE THEM. >> SO SABOT, I MEAN, YOU’VE BEEN UP THERE-- THIS IS YOUR FIRST SPACE FLIGHT AND YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BEING A FIRST TIME FLYER, BUT ESPECIALLY I WAS WATCHING YOU ON YOUR SPACEWALK AND YOU GOT A COUPLE MOMENTS TO-- DURING THE SPACEWALK LOOK DOWN AT THE EARTH. SO CAN YOU SORT OF DESCRIBE THAT EXPERIENCE? >> IT’S HARD TO TAKE IT ALL IN. IT’S SO MASSIVE. IT’ EVERYWHERE. THE THINGS THAT STUCK OUT IN MY MIND WERE SEEING-- AT NIGHT, SEEING FLASHES OF LIGHTENING THAT WENT ON FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. IN FACT, I’LL NEVER FORGET WHEN-- ON THE VERY FIRST SPACEWALK WHEN RANDY OPENED THE HATCH THE AIRLOCK JUST LIT UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE REFLECTED LIGHT COMING FROM THE EARTH INTO THE AIRLOCK. AND THE AIRLOCK’S A VERY CONFINED PLACE. IT DOESN’T HAVE-- IT’S WELL LIT, BUT IT’S NOT LIT LIKE THE SUN, AND SO IT CHANGED THE FEELING OF THE AIRLOCK DRAMATICALLY WHEN THAT HATCH OPENED UP AND THEN IT REALLY FELT REAL TO ME. >> THAT’S AWESOME. ALL RIGHT, ANOTHER QUESTION. COLIN ON FACEBOOK WANTS TO KNOW, “IF YOU GUYS TAKE SPACE SELFIES UP THERE?” MAYBE YOU GOT TO TAKE ONE ON YOUR SPACEWALK. >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. >> YEAH, I JUST POSTED SOMETHING FROM OUR LAST SPACEWALK ON TUESDAY WITH THE SPACE SELFIE AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU GOT THESE BIG INFLATED GLOVES ON AND YOU’RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS CAMERA. AND IT’S LIKE IF YOU WENT TO YOUR OVEN, AND GRABBED YOUR OVEN MITTS, AND THEN GRABBED YOUR CAMERA AND TRIED TO TAKE THE SELFIE. THAT’S WHAT IT’S KIND OF LIKE IN SPACE TRYING TO DO THAT, AND LINE IT UP, AND FEEL FOR THE BUTTON, AND GET THE SHOT. SO YOU END UP TRYING TO SQUEEZE IT A FEW TIMES. HOPEFULLY YOU SEE MAYBE THE SHUTTER ACTUALLY TOOK THE PICTURE. AND THEN YOU COME BACK INSIDE LATER ON AND GO, “HEY, DID I GET ANYTHING?” >> AMAZING. HEY, SO PAOLO, WE WERE KIND OF LOOKING AT SOME OF YOUR PHOTOS ON TWITTER, JUST THE ONES THAT YOU’RE SHARING. I SEE A LOT OF AMAZING PICTURES OF ITALY, BUT ONE THAT REALLY STUCK OUT IN MY MIND WAS A PICTURE OF MADAGASCAR AND THE LOGGING GOING ON THERE. JUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU SEE OF THE EARTH, WHAT SORTS OF IDEAS OF HUMAN INFLUENCE DO YOU SEE FROM 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH? >> WELL, WHEN YOU COME UP HERE AND YOU LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW, AND MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE OCEAN AND CLOUDS, AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU EVEN HAVE DIFFICULTIES ON SEEING THE ACTUAL GROUND, THE CONTINENTS. AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU START ACQUIRING THIS ACUITY, YOU LITERALLY START SEEING DETAILS. AND AT THE BEGINNING, THE HUMAN PRESENCE IS NOT SO EVIDENT, AND THEN IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE AND MORE EVIDENT, UP TO THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU GO THERE AND IT’S NIGHT YOU ESSENTIALLY SEE THE PLANET LIT UP, ALL THE CONTINENT’S LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE. AND IN SOME OF THE PLACES IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES ARE THE PRESENCE OF THE HUMAN BEINGS. IT’S INCREDIBLE. AND THEN, YOU START FOCUSING ON OTHER THINGS, LIKE YOU SEE RIVERS, YOU SEE HOW THERE’S A SHAPE. YOU SEE HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED, HOW AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TRYING TO MODEL NATURE ACCORDING TO OUR NEEDS AND NOT OURSELF ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF NATURE. AND THIS CHANGE BECOMES REALLY APPARENT. THERE IN THAT PICTURE THAT YOU’RE REFERRING TO, YOU SEE ESSENTIALLY ALL THE RED DIRT THAT IS WASHING OVER ON THE OCEAN. NOT ANYMORE KEPT BY THE FOREST BY THE PLANTS-- BY THE PLANTS THERE IN MADAGASCAR. AND THIS IS SO EVIDENT IT’S REALLY CLEAR FROM UP HERE THAT WE ARE A MAJOR FORCE INTO THIS PLANET AND WE ARE CHANGING NATURE. IS THAT GOOD, IS THAT BAD? I’M NOT SURE ABOUT IT. FOR SURE WE PROBABLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE ARE DOING IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT AS IT IS TODAY OR YESTERDAY. >> WOW, THAT’S REALLY INTERESTING. SIMILAR TO THAT, NATALIE IS ASKING, “IF YOU’VE OBSERVED A CHANGE IN COLOR OF THE SUNRISES AND SUNSETS DUE TO THE WILDFIRES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA?” OR MAYBE IF YOU’VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING, ANY OF THE WILDFIRES?” >> WE’VE SEEN THE WILDFIRES WHEN WE WERE OVER IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON LAST MONTH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY OUR DAY CYCLE WORKS, WE’RE NOT GOING OVER CALIFORNIA WHERE A TIME WHERE WE’RE TYPICALLY LOOKING OUTSIDE DURING DAYLIGHT. SO NONE OF US HAVE REALLY SEEN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES THAT MUCH YET. YOU CAN SEE CERTAINLY THE SMOKE OBSCURES THE LOOK DOWN, BUT HAVEN’T SEEN ANY CHANGES TO THE OVERALL ATMOSPHERE OR THE COLOR OF THE SUN BECAUSE IT’S JUST NOT THAT MANY-- THAT MUCH PARTICULATE WHEN YOU’RE LOOKING AT IT AT A GLOBAL SCALE. >> SO KOMRADE, KIND OF SIMILAR QUESTION. RECENTLY, AGAIN, WE WERE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE PHOTOS THAT YOU’RE SHARING ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT RECENTLY THERE’VE BEEN QUITE A FEW HURRICANES THAT HAVE HIT THE UNITED STATES, PUERTO RICO, A LOT OF THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS AND YOU SHARED YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF THAT VIEW. CAN YOU-- I MEAN, THE PICTURES CAN TELL ONE STORY, BUT JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING IT FROM THE SPACE STATION, THE HURRICANES? >> CERTAINLY, THE FORMATION OF WEATHER CAN BE A REAL BEAUTIFUL THING AND HURRICANES HAVE THEIR OWN SHAPE AND DO AMAZING THINGS WITH THE CLOUDS. BUT IT’S WHEN YOU REALIZE THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER UNDERNEATH IT IT CEASES BEING AS BEAUTIFUL. AND CERTAINLY, THE FIRST ONE FOR US WAS HURRICANE HARVEY THAT WENT RIGHT OVER OUR FAMILIES, AND OUR HOMES, AND OUR FRIENDS, AND MISSION CONTROL DOWN THERE IN HOUSTON. AND SO, THAT WAS-- YOU SAY, “TOO CLOSE TO HOME.” WELL, THAT WAS AT HOME SO THAT WAS TOO CLOSE TO HOME FOR US. SO THEN THE PARADE OF HURRICANES AFTER THAT WAS JUST DISHEARTENING BECAUSE THERE WERE JUST SO MANY, AND SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED, AND SO MUCH DEVASTATION THAT IT-- WE WERE TAKING PICTURES TO HOPEFULLY HELP THE RESEARCHERS THAT ARE USING THOSE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HURRICANES FORM, HOW THEY CONTINUE TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES, WHAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES. AND THEN, IT WAS TAKING PICTURES AFTERWARDS, HIGH RESOLUTION PHOTOGRAPHY, MAPPING THE AREAS TO SHOW WHERE THERE WAS FLOODING OR DESTRUCTION THAT WE DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE STILL WASN’T COMMUNICATION OR CAMERA CREWS WERE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PICTURE STUFF.              PICKING UP AT 24:00  SO IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE PROJECT THAT WE ENDED UP DOING, BUT HOPEFULLY THE WORK WE DID UP HERE TRANSLATES INTO SOME SCIENCE, AND WE’RE ABLE TO TRANSLATE IT INTO ACTUAL PRACTICAL STUFF THAT’LL HELP PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE. >> I WOULD THINK IT DID. IT’S SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. SEEING THE HURRICANES AND THE FLOODING AND ALL OF THAT FROM SPACE IS JUST REALLY AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU JUST CAN’T SEE WHEN YOU ARE RIGHT HERE NEXT TO IT. SO IT’S VERY INTERESTING. AND SIMILAR TO THAT, NATALIE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU COULD TALK TO US ABOUT THE WORF RACK, WHAT TYPES OF PHOTOS DO YOU TAKE FROM THERE, AND HOW DO YOU USE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR SCIENCE. >> YEAH, SO WE HAVE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WE’LL DO, AND ACTUALLY THE WORF RACK IS RIGHT HERE BENEATH US. IT’S ONE OF THE BEST WINDOWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE SPACE STATION. IT’S VERY WELL PROTECTED, SO VERY PRISTINE, AND WE CAN GET SOME REALLY COOL PHOTOS. UNFORTUNATELY FOR US, IT’S USUALLY COVERED UP, SO WE DON’T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT TOO OFTEN. BUT THERE’S A LOT OF SCIENCE THAT GOES ON. I KNOW WHEN I WAS HERE LAST TIME, WE HAD THE EARTHCAM PROJECT GOING ON WHERE MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE TAKING PHOTOS AND LEARNING ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. WE WERE ALSO USING IT FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES TO MAP DIFFERENT THINGS, SO IT’S A MULTIPURPOSE WINDOW, AND IT IS JUST A VERY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN GET FROM HERE. AND THEN YOU CAN PUT THE CAMERAS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES, YOU CAN DO THE DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR, DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY. SO IT HAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. IT’S PRETTY COOL. >> [ INDISTINCT ] >> THERE’S ALSO-- I KNOW WE’VE DONE-- THERE’S AN EXPERIMENT THAT’S BEEN GOING ON WITH ANALYZING THE SPECTRUM OF METEORS THAT ARE FALLING TOWARDS THE EARTH AND USING DIFFRACTION GRATINGS WITH THE LENS. SO THERE’S SOME REALLY INTERESTING SCIENCE THAT CAN COME OUT OF PHOTOGRAPHY. >> SO SABOT AND JOE, BOTH OF YOU HAVE BEEN EDUCATORS IN THE PAST, AND-- JOE JUST BEING A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER, AND SABOT WITH-- AT WEST POINT. BUT IS THERE SORT OF AN EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU CAN DO FROM SHARING YOUR VIEW OF THE EARTH? OR MAYBE SOME OTHER EXPERIMENTS YOU’RE DOING ONBOARD THE STATION THAT YOU CAN USE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. >> WELL, I THINK AS AN EDUCATOR, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN HAVE IS SHARING EXPERIENCES AND REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES. SO AS MUCH AS WE CAN DO THAT TO HELP TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND PROVIDE THEM MORE TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB. SINCE WE’VE BEEN HERE, IT’S BEEN NON-STOP. IT’S KIND OF LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, WHERE YOU’RE KIND OF GETTING ON YOUR FEET, GETTING THE BALL ROLLING. BUT THEN WE HAD DRAGON, AND THEN WE HAD TWO SPACEWALKS ALREADY, SO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT’S THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE WANT TO SHARE. AND HOPEFULLY BY DOING THAT AND BY RECORDING THAT, WHETHER IT’S WITH PHOTOS, VIDEO-- WE CAN SHARE THAT EXPERIENCES WITH TEACHERS WHO CAN THEN SHARE THAT WITH THEIR STUDENTS. >> THAT’S AWESOME. IT’S SO INTERESTING TO SO MANY OF US DOWN HERE, SO WE APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE AWESOME WORK YOU GUYS ARE DOING. I HAVE TO MENTION, KOMRADE, I’M GETTING A LOT OF COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK ABOUT YOUR SHIRT-- PEOPLE REALLY LOVE IT, SO I HAD TO TELL YOU THAT. JOSEPH WANTS TO KNOW, “WHAT’S THE MOST AMAZING PHOTO YOU TOOK?” SO DOES ANYBODY HAVE A FAVORITE PICTURE YET SO FAR? >> IT’S-- IT’S RELATIVELY EASY UP HERE TO DO TIME LAPSES, WHICH MEANS A LOT OF PHOTOS. AND THEY CAN GO GOOD OR TOTALLY BAD. I MEAN, I’VE DONE THOUSAND PICTURE COMPLETELY WASTED. THANK GOD IT’S NOT FILM ANYMORE AND ELECTRONS DON’T COST TOO MUCH. BUT I GOT A COUPLE OF TIME LAPSES PRETTY GOOD. THE ONE THAT I THINK WAS PROBABLY THE BEST IS ONE OF THE AURORA IN THE NORTH. SO IT WAS AURORA BOREALIS. AND I CAN-- I DON’T KNOW THAT NIGHT WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE SPACE OF THE AURORA, THE COLORS TOWARD THE GROUND, AND THE SHADOWS WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN UNDER US. AND THIS WAS, TO ME, INCREDIBLE, ALL THAT SEQUENCE OF PICTURES. >> AND I THINK PAOLO MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE EARTH IS EVER CHANGING. FOR ME, TO PICK OUT ONE AFTER JUST THE FEW MONTHS WE’VE BEEN HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE. IT’S EVERY DAY THERE’S ONE OR TWO THAT I GO, “WOW, THAT WAS JUST SO AMAZING. I’M SO FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEEN THAT.” AND THAT’S A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WE’RE TRYING TO POST AND SHARE WITH YOU GUYS, BECAUSE EVERY DAY IS FULL OF AMAZING PICTURES. AND MY FOLDER OF AMAZING PICTURES FROM SPACE JUST KEEPS GROWING DAILY. >> I’D SAY MY FAVORITE PHOTO SO FAR IS ONE OF, FRANKLY, ITALY AND THE ALPS THAT WE HAPPENED-- I THINK KOMRADE DREW MY ATTENTION TO IT, GOT ME TO LOOK DOWN DURING THE SPACEWALK, AND I SNAPPED A COUPLE PICTURES. THE CAMERA DID A LOT OF GREAT WORK FOR ME, BECAUSE ALL I COULD REALLY DO IN THAT SITUATION WAS PRESS THE BUTTON. AND THE PICTURES TURNED OUT GREAT-- REALLY BRIGHTLY LIT JAPANESE MODULE OF THE SPACE STATION IN THE FOREGROUND, AND ITALY AND THE ALPS IN THE BACKGROUND. >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> YEAH, AND IF I COULD JUST ADD, PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS TAKEN JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. AND KOMRADE AND I HAD A CONFERENCE THAT WAS SCHEDULED WITH SOME OF OUR FLIGHT DIRECTORS LOOKING AT THE UPCOMING SPACEWALK, AND ASKED OF ME, “WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW?” HE’S LIKE, “I THINK THAT’S SOUTH AMERICA.” AND I SAID, “WELL, IS PUERTO RICO GOING TO BE COMING UP?” AND HE’S LIKE, “WOW, THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.” SO WE GRABBED CAMERAS RIGHT AWAY, AND IT WAS JUST A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL RECOVERING OVER IN PUERTO RICO, SO HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THESE PICTURES OUT AND THEY CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THEIR ISLAND LOOKS FROM UP HERE. BUT IT WAS PRETTY COOL TO TAKE THAT TODAY. >> WOW, GOOD TIMING. THAT IS AWESOME. WE CAN’T WAIT TO SEE THOSE PICTURES, AND I KNOW THE PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO WILL BE REALLY, REALLY ANXIOUS TO SEE THAT. ALL RIGHT, SO WE’VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXPOSURE TIMES ON YOUR CAMERAS. CAN YOU GUYS TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT? >> TYPICALLY FOR DAYTIME EARTH OBS, WE’RE SHOOTING, A LOT OF TIMES, SHUTTER PRIORITY AND WE’RE SHOOTING FOR ONE OVER THE FOCAL LENGTH. SO IF YOU’VE GOT A 400MM LENS LIKE THIS BIG MONSTER, YOU’RE SHOOTING 1/400 AND LETTING THE CAMERA TAKE CARE OF THE APERTURE. NIGHTTIME IS CERTAINLY DIFFERENT. DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT WE’VE GOT MOON OR WE DON’T. AT THAT POINT, WE’RE SETTING UP THE CAMERAS ON ARMS SO THAT WE’RE NOT JIGGLING THEM, LIKE A TRIPOD ON THE GROUND. AND WE’RE SHOOTING ANYWHERE FROM A SECOND, TO TWO SECOND, UP TO EVEN-- PAOLO WAS SHOOTING THIS WEEK A TENTH OF A SECOND BECAUSE IT WAS SO BRIGHT WITH THE MOON OVER THE GROUND. SO YOU KIND OF ADJUST FOR THE CONDITIONS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SHOTS ON THE TIME OF DAY. >> GREAT, THANKS. ALL RIGHT, JESSICA IS SAYING, “HI FROM CHICAGO. CAN YOU RECALL A TIME WHEN YOU SAW SOMETHING FROM UP THERE THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CAPTURED ON CAMERA, OR SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN’T DO JUSTICE ON CAMERA THAT YOU WISH TO SHARE?” >> IT’S REALLY INTERESTING, BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO GET. AND ACTUALLY, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SEE, TO START WITH. MORE OR LESS YOU CAN PREDICT, BUT THE CONDITION CHANGES SO DRASTICALLY THAT YOU CAN WAIT FOR THE WHOLE DAY FOR A PASS OVER ITALY, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST TO DISCOVER THAT IT’S COMPLETELY COVERED BY CLOUDS. YOU DON’T EVEN SEE WHERE IT IS. OR THE OPPOSITE. OR YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING, YOU’RE THERE DOING EXERCISE. WE HAVE THE CUPOLA RIGHT THERE WHERE WE’RE DOING EXERCISE. YOU’RE THERE DOING A SET OF SOMETHING AND SUDDENLY, AN ISLAND APPEARS OUT OF THE BLUE AND IS INCREDIBLE COLORS. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST LOST THE QUESTION. WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? >> [ INDISTINCT ]. >> AH, YES. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT CANNOT BE-- I MEAN, THE CAMERA CANNOT TRANSLATE, AND-- BECAUSE IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE LIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE, I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE PICTURES WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN, BECAUSE THERE IS THIS HUGE BRIGHT SUN THERE AND YOU’RE TRYING TO CAPTURE SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU CANNOT DO IT. SO IN SPACE, THERE ARE HUGE CONTRASTS BETWEEN THE FULL DAY AND THE FULL NIGHT. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MIDDLE THERE, AND IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSITION. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE DO A NIGHTTIME TIME LAPSES AND WE SET UP THE CAMERA FOR NIGHT, AS SOON AS WE GET THE SUN, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SUN OUT IT’S TOTALLY WASHED OUT. AND I WOULD LOVE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO SHOW THIS TRANSITION AS WE SEE IT WITH THE EYE THAT ADJUSTS CONTINUOUSLY. THIS TRANSITION FROM NIGHT TO DAY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I STILL HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO IT. MAYBE WE’LL THINK ABOUT IT AND WE’LL WORK ON IT. >> WELL, KOMRADE, THAT KIND OF MAKES ME THINK OF-- I KNOW VERY SOON-- I THINK ON OCTOBER 23rd YOU WANT TO DO A SORT OF AROUND THE WORLD IN 90 MINUTES AND THEN KIND OF SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF A GREAT PASS OVER A LOT OF POPULATED CITIES AND VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE EARTH. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE FOR THAT, WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO DO OVER THOSE 90 MINUTES? >> WELL, IT’S NOT JUST ME. IT’S GOING TO END UP BEING A CREW PROJECT. AND THE THOUGHT WAS TO SHOW EVERYBODY ON THE GROUND WHAT IT’S LIKE, AND THE FEATURES THAT CAPTURE OUR ATTENTION DURING EACH MINUTE OF THOSE 90 MINUTES IN ONE REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH, WHETHER IT’S DAY OR NIGHT. AND IDEALLY PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED AND THEY CAN THEN ADD TO THE PROJECT AND THE CONVERSATION-- WHAT WAS GOING ON ON THE GROUND AT THAT MOMENT THEMSELVES-- AND KIND OF CREATE THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE CIRCLE THE GLOBE, AND WHAT WAS THE WORLD DOING AT THAT MOMENT? AND SO WE’LL BE TRYING TO TAKE THOSE PICTURES. I THINK WE HAVEN’T QUITE SETTLED ON A DATE YET, BUT YES, IT’LL BE AFTER WE FINISH OUR LAST EVAs, AND SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE IS A GLOBAL PROJECT THAT’LL INCLUDE MOST OF THE WORLD’S POPULATION THAT WE CAN GET IN A SINGLE PASS, AND REALLY SHOW OFF, SHOWCASE ONE REVOLUTION OF OUR PLANET. >> CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE PLANNED FOR THAT. WELL, GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME ON THE PODCAST TODAY AND SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF EARTH. IT’S JUST SO UNIQUE-- LITERALLY NO ONE ELSE ON THIS PLANET HAS THAT PERSPECTIVE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THAT. AND I KNOW THIS IS THE END OF THE DAY FOR YOU, TOO, SO AGAIN, APPRECIATE ALL FOUR OF YOU PARTICIPATING IN THIS. SO JUST WANT TO WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK ON THE REST OF YOUR MISSION, AND GODSPEED. CAN’T WAIT TIL YOU GUYS GET HOME. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GARY. WE’LL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT TIME WE GET TO TALK TO YOU, AND READY-- BREAK. >> STATION, THIS IS HOUSTON ACR. THAT CONCLUDES THE EVENT. >> THANK YOU TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS FROM JSC PAO. STATION, WE ARE NOW RESUMING OPERATIONAL AUDIO COMMUNICATION. >> AW, FANTASTIC. HOW ‘BOUT THAT, MEGAN? >> THAT WAS AMAZING! >> FOUR ASTRONAUTS. WE GOT TO SEE THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF THE PLANET. AND I KNOW WE WERE THROWN SOME IMAGES-- THOSE WERE ACTUAL IMAGES THAT THEY TOOK WHILE THEY WERE ACTUALLY-- SOME OF THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHY THAT THE CAMERA THEY ACTUALLY SHOWED WHILE THEY WERE UP THERE, BUT THEN SOME OF THOSE TIME LAPSES THAT PAOLO WAS TALKING ABOUT, TOO. ABSOLUTELY JUST SUCH A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. >> YEAH, IT’S SO COOL TO TALK TO THEM AND TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. AND OF COURSE, YOU CAN SEE ALL THOSE PICTURES ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. AND JUST AMAZING PICTURES THEY’VE TAKEN. >> YEAH, LET’S GO THROUGH THEM. SO WHO CAN WE FOLLOW ON THE STATION? >> ALL RIGHT, SO ALL FOUR OF THOSE GUYS WE JUST TALKED TO ARE ALL ON TWITTER, SO YOU CAN FOLLOW THEM ALL ON TWITTER. KOMRADE IS @ASTROKOMRADE. JOE IS @ASTROACABA. SABOT IS @ASTRO_SABOT. PAOLO IS @ASTRO_PAOLO. AND YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THE ASTRONAUTS AT @NASA_ASTRONAUTS. AND ALSO, KOMRADE AND PAOLO ARE ALSO ON INSTAGRAM. SO IF YOU LIKE INSTAGRAM, YOU CAN LOOK THEM UP ON INSTAGRAM AND SEE ALL THEIR PICTURES. >> THAT’S RIGHT, YEAH. AND WE TRY TO KIND OF CONSOLIDATE THAT INTO THAT ASTRONAUTS ACCOUNT, TOO, SO YOU CAN JUST SEE EVERYONE’S PICTURES. AND THEY ARE SOME AMAZING PHOTOS. AGAIN, THESE PHOTOS THAT WE’RE SHARING WITH YOU, A LOT OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY SHARED ON THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNT, SO YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG ON THAT JOURNEY. AND I KNOW THAT EACH OF THEM HAVE A COUPLE MONTHS LEFT, SO THERE’S PLENTY OF IMAGES TO SEE OVER THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 195, “Trailblazing International Partnerships.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America’s space exploration program. Today, the world comes to Houston to talk about the confederation of nations behind the success that is the International Space Station. There have been people on board the International Space Station for more than 20 years now without interruption. But the story of the beginnings of the project goes back years before that. Short version, not from the very beginning: in his State of the Union message in 1984, President Reagan announced that he directed NASA to develop a permanently manned space station; less than two years later, Europe, Japan and Canada had agreed to participate. The Soviet Union, which flew one joint mission with NASA in 1975, had flown a series of space stations all on its own before launching the first components of the Mir station in 1986. And after the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990's, the Russian Federation agreed to team up with the U.S. and the others. It was an unprecedented global partnership, dependent on the contributions of all and providing benefits to all. Today, representatives from each of the five partner space agencies discuss how they've stayed together all these years and what they've gained from a generation of international cooperation in space. This is the fifth in a series of NASA-sponsored panel discussions in recognition of the 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the station. We brought you the others starting in February. This time, representatives of NASA and the other partner space agencies discuss how their partnership has worked and improved over more than 20 years now. The moderator is veteran journalist Jeanne Meserve, and she'll introduce you to NASA's International Space Station Program Manager Joel Montalbano and representatives from the four other national space agencies that make up the partnership. OK then, here we go.  [ Music]  Jeanne Meserve: Hi, I'm Jeanne Meserve, and it's my pleasure to host a conversation that really is life- and world-changing. Today, I am joined on the program by the five primary partners of the International Space Station. Let me introduce them now. Joel Montalbano of NASA, Frank De Winne of the European Space Agency, Luc Dube of the Canadian Space Agency, Junichi Sakai of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Sergei Krikalev of Roscosmos with the Russian Federation. Welcome to all of you, great to have you with us. And a special thank you to NASA for their assistance in assembling these leaders, and to the Space Foundation Space Symposium 365 platform. And now, let's go. Joel Montalbano let me start with you. A lot of relationships don't work for 20 years, but this one has. Can you explain why this relationship is still going on, and successfully?  Joel Montalbano: Well, excellent question and hello to everyone and thank you for getting together today. You know, to me it works because we help each other, we learn from each other, and we cooperate from each other. You know, throughout the 20-plus years of the International Space Station, whenever we've had a challenge, there's another partner that's always ready to step up and help wherever they can. Across the 20-plus years that we've seen operations of the International Space Station, you know, we've had those opportunities and every single time, it -- a partner has reached out to another partner when they were in need. And to me, that has been the biggest success of the International Space Station.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei Krikalev, do you want to weigh in on why this has been successful?  Sergei Krikalev: Joel already mentioned that this probably was successful for the last 20 years because it really started earlier than 20 years ago. We start our first joint mission in 1975, Apollo-Soyuz mission. We start our joint flights on shuttle and on Mir station, in begin of the ‘90s, so—in middle of ‘90s—so I think, the main reason why it works after that was because we have a really strong desire to do this. And this was first part, and second part is that we have very good professionals who were doing this. Because good professionals have a really big desire to be successful, we were successful for these 20 years.  Jeanne Meserve: There are, as you all know, skeptics on Earth who are asking why are we spending this much money on space exploration. Mr. De Winne, can you tell us what value the space station has brought to people on Earth?  Frank De Winne: Well, one of the biggest values, of course, is the cooperation itself. And we see around the world, it's not always so easy for big nations to work together. And this partnership has shown that if you have a common goal, if you want to work together, that you can achieve great things. And I think the example that it sets in that area is tremendous. But it has also brought very specific results. For example, ESA has done the experiment Airway Monitoring, where we studied the lung functions of astronauts on board of the space station. Well, the results of that research have led to new technologies, new tests that can be used on asthma patients, and as a result of that 300,000 patients have been tested, 36 million tests have been performed and those patients have received specific medication for their disease, which had a direct impact on their quality of life. Another example is, for example, the MELFI (Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) freezer, that we have on board of the International Space Station. It freezes our samples up to minus 80 degrees. Well, the technology that is used to maintain those kinds of temperatures on board of the International Space Station is now used on big ships that transport gas. And this gas that normally boils off can be recycled. And due to that, we are recycling per year, 100,000 tons of CO2 carbon emissions, meaning that it has a direct impact on fighting climate change. These are only two examples, but I know that our partners, across the board, have many more, have thousands of examples, how research, innovation on the International Space Station has directly impacted the life of the citizens around the planet.  Joel Montalbano: You know, I'll say a couple things. You know on the, you know, Frank mentioned the, the freezers we have on board and the minus 80-degree freezers. You know we, because of the assets we have on the International Space Station, and the need for us to transport across the globe, we have reached out to help these drug companies that are about to start distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. And using our experience and offering up this experience that we have globally to help this global pandemic. So, to me, it's just one, one of the many examples where we can capitalize on the International Space Station and what we've learned over these 20-plus years to help others and to benefit humans on Earth.  Jeanne Meserve: Political winds blow, leadership changes; Joel Montalbano, let me start with you, on how you think these sorts of changes impact the International Space Station?  Joel Montalbano: You know, over the 20-plus years, we've had leadership changes, and all our agencies and the governments associated with them, and you know, throughout that, the standard that's been cooperation. And we've been able to cooperate while meeting the different national priorities of the different agencies. And to me, the benefit of the International Space Station is we work on a physics base, and physics is the same across the globe. So, regardless of any political change and leadership change, we're able to manage and operate the International Space Station, we're able to communicate because we're communicating in the physics-type method. We're able to operate and stay below any political-type challenges, but we still are able to meet each agency's national goals.  Jeanne Meserve: Well, your agencies have worked together for two decades now, amazingly; what are some of the things that you are able to do now that you could not do 20 years ago? Mr. Dube, why don't you go ahead with that one.  Luc Dube: So, in our case, you know, our original operation concept for the Canadarm2 and Dextre was based on how the shuttle arm was operated with astronaut driving at every step. But what we do now looks nothing like that. The CSA flight control room, which hosts the CSA flight controller, is now used a lot. The development of our ground segment is a big part of the ground…completely controlling the robots from the ground is now most of the way we operate. So, we work also with the American and the Japanese partner. We also added the capability to capture free-flying cargo vehicle. So, since 2009, we have done 43 free-flyer captures. We also have unexpectedly become a key provider for robotics services to external payload. So as a result, the demand of our robotics has gone up and up. So, we have started also developing autonomous control on our ISS robots. So, this will become the basis for how we design and operate on our future systems.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. Sakai, do you want to weigh in on this question of what you can do now that you couldn't do ten or 15 years ago?  Junichi Sakai: Yeah, we are able to proceed a variety of new transitions that were not originally expected due to the great efforts of engineers and researchers on the ISS. For example, there is a research in space medicine that will be useful for human, future human exploration, and the private sector is actively utilizing the ISS. We are also trying commercial components in the ISS; the success of Crew Dragon is also an epoch-making event. If I may appeal to you, the Japanese experimental module Kibo has both a robotic airlock and a robotic arm to conduct CubeSat deployment and material exposure experiment. It was developed by an engineer's idea after Kibo become operational. We have learned that since having expandability, fosters a new tradition and future needs. I also believe that one of the achievements is that ISS international partners have been also to discuss on the, consider the Gateway, the next human space station based on the ISS cooperative experiments of the ISS program.  Jeanne Meserve: Has the International Space Station changed your countries and your countries’ aspirations in space? This is something I would like all of you to respond to, but Mr. Krikalev, why don't we start with you. Has it changed the outlook?  Sergei Krikalev: In the beginning of course, although we have experience of international cooperation on previous stations, but still was a pretty big concern how well we can work together, what is going to be result of our work, and how we will move forward together. Now, we know that this partnership is working really well, and now we are looking on the station not only as a platform for current exploration but also as a platform for future exploration. We use space station as a test bed for new technology, for new experiments that, a result of this experiment, we expect will be useful for future space exploration, beyond low-Earth orbit.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. De Winne, do you want to weigh into this? Obviously, countries plural in your case. Has the ISS changed things, in terms of, space aspirations in Europe?  Frank De Winne: Absolutely, it has changed a lot. I'm coming from a small country myself, Belgium, but nevertheless, I was able to fly to space twice. Without an international corporation, like the International Space Station, this would of course not have been possible. And today, we see we are actually starting a new astronaut selection in Europe in the next months. We see that a lot of countries have the aspiration to have their citizens flying to space. And I'm sure that in the future, every European citizen can have these dreams. And this is of course, relating directly to young people who have to invest in STEM, science, technology, engineering, and math, skills that we will need to build further our society in the future. But of course, it's not only linked to human spaceflight and to what we do on board of the International Space Station. There are so many other domains in space, navigation, Earth observation, telecommunications, where we will need a lot of people. And the fact that we can work in cooperation, that there is a visible element that people can see in the sky every night and say, my citizens, they are flying there, they are working there for the benefit of humankind, has dramatically changed the way Europeans look to space.  Jeanne Meserve: Luc Dube, how about you? What are your thoughts?  Luc Dube: Yeah, so our contribution, the Canadian arm, has allowed Canada to become a world leader in space robotics. It's also given us the access to a big laboratory for science and allowed Canada to have its astronauts fly long-duration mission and international cooperation. It's also helped promoting the space in Canada and was key for the development of such in the industries and the academia. So, it's inspired future generations in science and technology, education. So, it's a dream to come true for many Canadians. So, we are very proud to contribute to such an important research opportunities. It is largely thanks to the ISS that the space community in Canada are now setting their sights on this nation like the Moon and Mars. So, for 20 years the ISS has been a vital test bed that enables us to prepare to explore deeper into space. So, the Canadian Space Agency is very proud to play a big role in this endeavor.  Jeanne Meserve: Joel Montalbano, your thoughts?  Joel Montalbano: You know, as you heard from Sergei and Frank and Luc, this space station has inspired a generation that is going to take us from low-Earth orbit, where we are today, to return to the Moon and then eventually to Mars, and we're using the experiences we have on the International Space Station. You know, going back to your last question, you talked about things have changed over the last ten or 15 years, and when we first started this project, we, each of the agencies, had really individual, a lot of individual projects. And what we've learned over time is, if we work together and we cooperate and we combine assets and combine resources, we can do much more with the International Space Station. And that, that learning that we've done on the International Space Station has spilled over outside of just human spaceflight. And the, and the science mission directorates that we cooperate internationally across the different agencies, we've taken the lessons learned from space station and we've used that to cooperate in those areas as well. That they based it on what we did on the International Space Station. So, to me just, it's been pretty cool. It's been cool to watch, and it's been just an awesome adventure so far.  Jeanne Meserve: And if I could just follow up on that with you. In the current world of budgetary constraints, is this kind of international cooperation necessary in space, simply from a financial point of view?  Joel Montalbano: It's mandatory, in my mind. You know, we've learned a long time ago that any single agency does not have the resources to do everything they want to do. And, but when you combine, you put all these agencies together, we can accomplish so much more, and we have been. And the cool thing is, we've demonstrated—we don't just talk about it, we do it, and that's one of the best things about the International Space Station. I'm a little biased as the, as, you know, the NASA program manager, but I can tell you the people we're talking to today, I know would sign up right behind me and agree.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. Sakai, we didn't get your thoughts on that initial question of how the ISS has changed your country and its aspirations in space?  Junichi Sakai: Oh well, I guess I, the ISS program and its accomplishment has changed the LEO transition easier than previous. But it's not only allowed for some special person, but for everyone having what he wants to something, wants to try something in LEO. ISS accomplishment in many different areas. For example, basic science; scientific research; practical research, leading to industrialization; education of youth of the next generations; international cooperations, etc. And JAXA as a only ISS participant in Asia, provides opportunities for Asian countries to utilize Kibo, while building cooperation in the space field and promoting the significance of space experiments for each country.  Jeanne Meserve: Space is becoming more and more of a commercial enterprise, and I'm wondering how that's going to change the ISS and potentially your partnership with one another. Joel Montalbano, you want to handle that first?  Joel Montalbano: You know, so the first ten years of space station were dedicated really to assembly. And then, after assembly, we moved into a utilization, research, technology development where we're actually, optimizing the use of the International Space Station. And then in these last, say, five or six years, we've been developing this commercial market in the U.S. and working with our partners to understand, you know, what it means to them and how we can help and how we can utilize the great space station we have. You know, in our mind, we’ve, we've been able to optimize with these commercial partners the use of the International Space Station. This weekend we had the hundredth launch of the Falcon 9 rocket. And, you know, because we'd helped develop that rocket, we've helped develop the Antares rocket for Northrop Grumman, and we've taken those activities as well as other activities and we've brought items to the International Space Station, we've opened doors to the International Space Station for additional research and utilization, technology development on board. And now we've opened these opportunities to commercial, and it's not just NASA: Russia's done it, Canada has done it, you now, ESA has done it, JAXA has done it, we've all, you know, we're all starting in different places, but we're all moving and trying to optimize the use of commercialization and use this great resource that we have on board the International Space Station.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei Krikalev, you want to weigh in on that commercialization question?  Sergei Krikalev: I can just add, what Joel said that we really started from some simple things like, we were flying tourist, flight participants as we call them, to space and it was only one side of commercialization. But now, we see much more opportunities, such as, commercial experiments, and we know that some, some companies need some data using space environment. And we can use it, space station can be used to provide this data. So, the variety of a commercial application is much bigger than it was a while ago.  Jeanne Meserve: Frank De Winne, from the European perspective, any downside to the commercialization, or is this all a big plus?  Frank De Winne: Well, the main is a big plus of course, and again it shows very clearly the agility of the partnership, because we have done so many new things with this partnership, under this agreement that was signed probably 25 years ago, and that we have been able to adapt to the new environment and to the new world. Of course, it's also put some strains on the, on the system, because the commercial companies, they want their data quicker, they want better access, they want easier access. So it also strains, on our side, the way that we operate. We need to completely, continuously, rethink what we can do, how we can better now service the customer, another customer, because initially, our customers were only the scientists and they were used to work with us. Now, we have to get used to work with other entities that have other drivers. So it's not always easy, but it shows for the agility of the partnership that again, not one of the agencies apart is able to do that, but through the cooperation, through exchanging experiences, how we do that, we are able to manage this, this great new endeavor. And at the end, of course, the aim is to build an economy in low-Earth orbit. The aim is not that we, as agencies, we continue to operate, and to fly, and to build everything in low-Earth orbit, but that there is a real economy and we are just one of the users of the systems that will be there. And then we can focus, as was said already by a number of our guests, we can focus on exploration. The Gateway, going to the surface of the Moon and eventually to Mars: this is where we should have to shift our focus of the agencies in the next ten to 20 years.  Jeanne Meserve: Could I -- follow up a moment and ask you about the strains that the commercial enterprises are putting on the system? Can you be specific about what you're talking about?  Frank De Winne: Well, of course, if you have a commercial company that says I want to do my research on board of the space station, they want to have, of course, a guarantee that they can fly. They want to have return on investment, that's everything that is there about the commercial companies. So, how do we manage this as agencies? How do we put the priorities right with our member states, especially in ESA, because they fund the national science? How do we manage all these different inputs that we are getting, these different requirements that we are getting? And this is something that we need to learn. We are not there yet, we are not fully 100% proficient yet, but I'm sure that we will get there over time.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei Krikalev, what advice you might have for future projects that are this complex?  Sergei Krikalev: I think what we experienced from very beginning, that on top of a regular work relationship, we start to build personal relationship inside the program. And I think this is very important because we, in this way, we can trust each other, we know each other better. And I think, from my point of view at least, it's one of the big advantages we have through this program, because now I have friends in Europe, in European Space Agency, in (United) States, in Canada, in Japan, and with some people we work closer together in space with, some people we were working together here on the ground and mission control. But I think this is probably one of the reasons why our program was successful because we start to build trust to each other. And I think it's based on a personal relationship and I treasure this as a part of my life experience.  Jeanne Meserve: And in terms of the challenges of designing and building, what did you learn? What would you do differently if you were to do it again, Mr. Krikalev?  Sergei Krikalev: I think we have different learning in different stages. Because sometimes, we try to do things standard and it has some advantages. But also, the labs show that things still different. We have one voltage on Russian segment, we have a different voltage on U.S. segment, and it has pluses and minuses. And because station's basically the lab where we can learn what is the best way to operate, having a variety of technical solution, we will have more data. And even if we found out that one of the solutions is not as good as another, but if we wouldn't try, we wouldn't know about this. So, I think having this variety is also good for the station and for the program in general.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. Dube, what are your thoughts on this, on the challenges of design and build and what might be done differently?  Luc Dube: Yeah, I think the fact that it's so complex, there's a need to have continuous communication between the partners, especially, during the design phases. Because there will be a lot of changes that will impact each other, so we need to better define interface and well define also the role and responsibilities of every partner. I know like on the ISS program, at the beginning during the design phase, we had a couple of changes over time and it impacted us on our design for the Canadarm, and, and it cost a lot of money and also had a big impact also on the schedule. So, those need to be defined clearly and also on a regular basis to make sure that at least we could react quickly on those changes, so.  Jeanne Meserve: Joel Montalbano, do you want to weigh in on this as well, how future projects that might be very complex, might have learned from the ISS experience?  Joel Montalbano: My biggest advice, and I talk to our Gateway folks all the time, is you can't start soon enough talking globally. You got to get out of this idea of, you know, a single agency item. This has to be a global endeavor, it has to be a global partnership, and the sooner you can start working together and the sooner you can start sharing, you know, desires, needs, requirements on how you want to operate, to me, you can't start early enough. It's a huge benefit of the International Space Station. You know, when we first started it, you know, we were all kind of getting to know how each other operates and you can imagine that comes with some different challenges. You know, think of a, of a marriage, you start with a marriage, you know, you -- it's, you're starting to learn each other. Today, we operate and, again, I'm probably a little biased, I believe we operate seamlessly. You know, when we have an issue, we're ready to work together and we can solve things so much quicker today than we did in the early days. And it's because of what we've done and, you know, with our global partnership. And so, I tell the Gateway guys all the time, start early and keep pressing in that direction.  Jeanne Meserve: And specifically, I presume, when it comes to design and build, you have to get talking to one another at the design phase, early, correct?  Joel Montalbano: Absolutely, absolutely. And, you know, it's, you know, this pandemic makes it hard, right, for some, for some people, and it's harder for us, you know, no doubt. But the beauty of space station is, because of all the different time zones, we've already been operating remotely. We had a lot of practice in the International Space Station. So, while the pandemic has added different challenges, we can't see each other face to face like we, like we need to and like we've, you know, we've done in the past, we have some experience on this and we're able to use that. So, I'll tell you that while the pandemic's been hard on everybody, it could have been a lot harder if we didn't have this partnership already well established.  Jeanne Meserve: Somebody else want to weigh in on this question of boundaries being pushed out further and further, and how the partnership can help enable some of these very ambitious missions that are now on the drawing boards? Sergei Krikalev, you want to take a stab at that?  Sergei Krikalev: Joel already talk about this, that if, we work together, all the time we work in some limits. We have financial limits, we have work resources limitations. And working together we can, inside the same limits we can, move much further. Combining our efforts, we can do more things than we, we would be able to do if we work alone.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. De Winne, I wanted to ask you the same question about pushing out boundaries and how the ISS lessons can be applied and will enable future missions?  Frank De Winne: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's mandatory that in the future if we want to go further that we will have to cooperate, that we will have to work together. And again, the friendship and the trust—and the word trust was used a couple of times—that we have built in this partnership has allowed us, for example, to move, to move much faster in the way that we have set up the Gateway program. But the Gateway program is, yes, it's going towards the Moon, but at the end, we all want to explore together the surface of the Moon. And even later on, we want to go to Mars. And this will be impossible if we don't continue to build this trust, build on the lessons that we have learned from the ISS and, and just work together in ever more complex missions and ever more complex systems. Because yes, the ISS is very complex, but imagine that one day we have to fly with six or ten young people to Mars and bring them safely back. The complexity of that, today, we, I don't think that we can even imagine. And so we will need all the forces and all the minds, bright minds, in all the agencies that are there around the world.  Jeanne Meserve: Joel Montalbano, I'd like to come back to you. You have offered a few thoughts already on what other space agencies might learn from the ISS experience. I'm wondering if you have any additional words of wisdom that you would like to share?  Joel Montalbano: Probably the, you know, in addition to what I've said is, my words of wisdom then would be just, get started. Try, you know, you don't have to go for the biggest, the biggest success right off the bat. Try and fly a payload or two on the International Space Station, see how that works, try and understand the processes, allow us to show what we can do as a partnership. You know, fly a small payload, then fly a larger payload, then fly a person on board. You know, you see some of the work with UAE, where they, United Arab Emirates, where they flew an astronaut on board the International Space Station. So, they're taking steps over time. Get in the game is, would be my biggest, my next set of wisdom is, just get in the game and let us play together.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. Sakai, do you have any thoughts on this that you'd like to share with others?  Junichi Sakai: Yeah. I'm not sure that this is the appropriate word but, ISS program allows to stay known ISS partners or participant’s astronauts at the ISS. As you know may, as you may know, Roscosmos has already mediated several private astronaut. The Crew-1 launched successfully on November 15th. So, I guess the area, the era of a commercial human spaceflight will be opened up soon. There is a country hesitates that human spaceflight not belonging in human space environment, or its difficulty. I recommend to try the [inaudible] service of ISS you transition to demonstrate the technology for the human space environment. Through this -- demonstration, they can learn the philosophy of a human spaceflight and the detail requirement of human safety. In the future, a human space activity will expand from the LEO to the Moon, but the further we go, the greater the cost of the transportation and the communication, and the greater the technical risks. It is difficult to carry out a mission in a single country. And I believe that the most economical and efficient way to carry out a mission is for the countries to cooperate with each other in a mutually-beneficial relationship. I hope a lot of countries develop their own strengths and promote international cooperations using their strengths as a contribution.  Jeanne Meserve: Mr. Krikalev do you have any additional words of wisdom you'd like to share with some other space agencies around the world?  Sergei Krikalev: I would like to say that human spaceflight is a very wide area. And it's not necessarily to fly a person to space to be participant of this human spaceflight exploration. Because, like, space or human spaceflight-related science, it can be life science, it can be fundamental physics science. There is a big variety of activity that can be done by especially new agencies; they can do specific scientific experiment. And in many cases, it can be done on automated spacecrafts, on satellites. But in many cases, it's much more efficient, actually, to do on human spaceflights. So really, a space station is a very good test bed for new experiment, new tests, preparation for future flights, and being participant of this, has very different, very many different applications.  Jeanne Meserve: I want to thank all of you for your comments and reflections on what has been just an incredible International Space Station adventure. We're grateful to everybody for taking part in this and we look forward to even more shared adventures living off of planet Earth, and a future with even more bold milestones. Thanks so much.  [ Music]  Host: NASA's first efforts in the realm of human spaceflight, Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, were designed to satisfy a national goal, an American goal of winning the Space Race by being the first country to put people on the Moon. But as the Space Age progressed, NASA's collaborated with the world’s other national space agencies more and more, to achieve a succession of advances in human spaceflight, sharing the costs incurred as well as the knowledge gained. The International Space Station is an unmistakable symbol of the success of that joint international effort, and an example of the kinds of success the inhabitants of planet Earth may be able to achieve if they continue to work together on efforts to return to the Moon, and to go on to Mars. Well, there's more to come on this celebration of the space station’s 20th anniversary. The next discussion focuses on the future. What the International Space Station has helped the nations of the world build and how that will contribute to their future in space. Coming up in a couple of weeks.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 109, “Women of JSC: Apollo to Artemis.” I'm Pat Ryan. And I'm joined in introducing today's podcast by Jessica Vos, a name and voice that long-time listeners may recall. Jessica is an Orion spacecraft crew systems engineer who talked with Gary Jordan back on Episode 28 about how the new Orion spaceship is designed to accommodate its human crew members for missions into deep space. She's also the current chair of the Women Excelling in Life and Leadership Employee Resource Group. More commonly known here on site at JSC at WELL. Jessica, welcome back.  Jessica Vos: Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here in this different capacity this time.  Host: All right, let's set the stage. Because I want people to understand what is WELL, your organization? What does it do here at JSC?  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So at JSC we are really lucky in that our leadership truly believes that employees are our greatest asset. Mainly because of the fact that their diverse experiences backgrounds and skills that they each bring to work every day are truly what make us competitive and successful. Especially in this type of industry. So at JSC we have nine employee resource groups.  Host: Nine.  Jessica Vos: Which is quite a few, yeah. We have nine. And they're all a part of the Inclusion and Innovation Council Initiative, the I&I Council Initiative. And what's really awesome is that the leadership is all made up of employee volunteers. This is a side job for everybody.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: And a side job that we don't get paid for. And rarely thanked for honestly.  Host: Oh, come on.  Jessica Vos: But they do incredible work. Including things like this panel. In general, all the ERGs provide augmented support to the existing management tools and HR systems that are already in place for recruiting and onboarding. Knowledge sharing. Workforce engagement. And employer retention. But we do it that are in ways that are specific to the needs of our membership, the ERG membership.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: So we really want to enable each and every individual employee to be able to bring their authentic selves to work every day and uniquely contribute to the agency's mission.  Host: Now, in a minute here we're going to let people hear a panel presentation that WELL organized. What's the goal in having this event?  Jessica Vos: So you may have been a part of, long-time listeners as you mentioned earlier. You may be familiar with the fact that this year has been really exciting for NASA. There's a couple of things; right?  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: That are huge accomplishments that we're celebrating.  Host: There's something about Apollo.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, something like landing, moon, lunar landing thing. So, yeah, it's been really incredible. And we are doing this as a part of the 50th anniversary events of Apollo 11. And we also wanted to focus on the fact that along with that announcement or along with that celebration, there's been an announcement that we're going back to the moon.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: In 2024 with the Artemis mission. So we really want, we are excited about being able to continue the human exploration of deep space in a different way. A more sustainable way. And we realize that that's going to look different and feel different. And require a lot of different methods and technologies than what we had in Apollo. So we thought it would be really neat to have a panel that kind of highlights the legacy of women here at JSC. And how they supported the Apollo program. And how they're currently supporting Artemis and human space flight in general. So this panel is going to touch on one of the main objectives of the I&I Council. Which is really to inspire the next generation and promote the agency's mission. So as we were saying, the incredible accomplishments of the Apollo program were fuelled by the extraordinary efforts of multiple teams of people learning and creating brand new ways to solve problems that had never been approached, right, let alone solved before. So in many ways the team supporting Artemis are in the same boat. Because while the overall goal of getting to the moon is the same as Apollo, the means and objectives of Artemis are quite different. Along with things like the political climate. The international partner engagement. Budgetary constraints. All of the, you know, the whole context in which we're accomplishing this goal now is very different. And for this panel specifically, taking place intentionally on women's equality day, August 26th.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: We wanted to highlight the legacy of women at JSC who supported the Apollo program side by side with the perspectives of the women currently supporting the efforts to advance our ability to achieve future human space flight missions.  Host: Okay, would you do the honors then. Introduce us to the ladies that we're going to hear in the presentation coming up momentarily.  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So today we're thrilled to have an incredible group of women who bring a really diverse suite of experts, sorry, expertise and experiences to the table. And I'll start off with a very dear friend of mine Dr. Jennifer Rochlis. She is the panel moderator. She brings over 20 years of experience to the table. And has supported many different organizations here on site at JSC. Including the Engineering Directorate, human resources and the Human Health and Performance Directorate. We're also super lucky because she has authored publications and book chapters in the areas of human factors engineering and human systems integration design. Including NASA's very own HSI, Human Systems Integration practitioners guide. She's also the founder and former chair of the HSI ERG who we're co-hosting this event with.  Host: Oh, okay.  Jessica Vos: So she's going to do an incredible job as moderator. We also have, for the first panelist from the Apollo era, is Mary Dunseith Henry. She has served, worked on site through Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. From Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. And she, I'm not going to give it away here. But she has an incredible story to tell that you probably know that includes Apollo 11.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Right? And she has a really fun story to tell there. But she supported as a administrative specialist and external relations employee in that time. We also have Dianne Milner who supported here in the Apollo era and still currently works here today.  Host: Oh.  Jessica Vos: She started here back in Mercury.  Host: Goodness.  Jessica Vos: So she may be the longest employee, like, longest employee here.  Host: Badge number two.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, exactly. So we're sure that she's going to have quite a neat perspective to share just from having crossed that many different programs and been here that long. She's really truly seen the highs and lows that NASA has experienced in all of our programs; right? So that will be incredible to hear from her. And then the third Apollo era guest that we have or panelist that west is Estella Hernandez-Gillette. She was supporting the Apollo program as a stenographer and clerk for the engineering directorate. She started in 1964. And she supported, sorry, she was employed here at JSC for 42 years. She's now a professor down at University of Houston. So local. And she also served as the EO director, the equal opportunity office director here at --  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: JSC for ten years. And then she, when she retired in 2006, she was serving as the deputy of external relations. So very interesting.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Background there. And then we have two current panelists, meaning, as in they work here at JSC Today.  Host: Now.  Jessica Vos: And maybe a little bit younger as well. The first one is Dr. Sarah Wallace. She's a microbiologist. And she is the technical lead in our microbiology laboratory here on site. You may recall here name. She, has she done a podcast with you before?  Host: She did. She talked about the genes in space experiment.  Jessica Vos: Right.  Host: Where they identified microbes from start to finish without knowing what they were --  Jessica Vos: Right, DNA sequencing.  Host: In space for the first time.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, so she'll have, she has quite a bit of involvement in how it is that we are mitigating some of those risks for future space flight. Both to moon and beyond.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: Hopefully Mars; right? So it will be awesome to hear from her. And then the last panelist will be Miss Ashley White. She is an equal opportunity specialist here at JSC. She has also served as an accountant in JSC's travel office. And a human resource representative in the human resource office. So she has had a few different supporting orgs as well. And she, in general, has a lot of experience working with and supporting the women here at JSC. Both through our ERGs and otherwise. So, yeah, it's going to be a really awesome panel.  Host: All right then, “Women of JSC: Apollo to Artemis.” Here we go.  [ Music ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Okay, you guys ready to get started? Okay, Mary, I would love to start with you. Can you tell us what JSC was like when you first got here. And walk us through some of your first day at work.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, what JSC was like when I first got here was as exciting as the day that I left. I had come in from, I was working for the Air Force. And because of the Vietnam War my family wanted me back in Houston. So I was transferring from Macon, Georgia. Warner Robins Air Force Base to Ellington Field. But when I got to Ellington to interview, they had a freeze on. And so the young lady at human resources said, you can go to this organization down the road. We don't think it will be here long. But once our freeze is over, you can come back. So I went down the road and was fortunate enough to be hired. And never went back to the Air Force. It was an exciting time. We were a family. There was a large group, but a small group really in comparison to what was going on at the time. And I came right after the fire. So there was lot of mixed emotions going on at that time. And a lot of \"we can do\" going on at that time. And whether you were a secretary. An engineer. An admin. Or the telephone guy. Or the cafeteria. You were all part of a family. And it was a terrific family so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. [Inaudible] Hello. Got it, okay. Did I get yours, Dianne? You want to check it?  Dianne Milner: Hello.  Jessica Vos: Okay, good. Because I'm going to toss this to you real quickly because Dianne just told us the story of her first day on site. And I thought that was something worth sharing as well.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: I thought I was in prison. I went to the Rich Building that first summer that I worked here. And I didn't have my interim secret clearance yet. So I had to be escorted from the lobby to my desk. And then each trip to the bathroom, she was like a matron, you know, out of, right out of a prison. Would escort me down and wait and then escort me back. So but after that, you know, I got my interim secret clearance. I was all over the warehouse. The lab. Met people. Met my future husband. So I made the best of it after that. It was not a prison any longer.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Ashley, can you tell us a little bit about what brought to you NASA and how you got into the industry?  Ashley White: Sure. Thank you for the opportunity to be on this panel with these illustrious women. So my story is a little different. Back in 2002, I was a sophomore at Prairie View A&M University. And we were having a career fair. And I will never forget it. We were walking around the Baby Dome. That's where the career fair was. And your feet are hurting because you're wearing shoes that you're not used to wearing. And I see the NASA booth. And I go, oh, there's no way, I was an accounting major. They don't want me. That's not for me. But my mother said apply for every opportunity. But nobody was at the table. They had already gone to lunch. So I may or may not have put my resume at the very top of the pile. And I may or may not have stood there for a while and made sure that my resume kept going to the top of the pile. And then I just walked away. Two weeks later I got a call from Anne Roemer saying, hey, would you be interested in a co-op opportunity. And I thought, at NASA? You, like, for, I'm not an engineer. Let me just really make that clear. No, no, no, we have business co-ops. Okay. Two weeks later we were on site. My grandparents had brought me here. But I may have forgotten my license at campus. So, you know, you can't get on site. So I had my interview in Building 110 in one of those back conference rooms. And I started that next week in January 2003. And this is the only company I've ever worked for.  [ Applause ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Sarah, I want to ask you a question about your org. And we're going to talk about your work a little bit later. But a lot of times, when we do lessons learned, we focus on what should we do better? And I really like to highlight for sure the things that we're already doing really well. That we want to keep doing really well. And so I want Sarah to talk a little bit about what she feels like in her discipline and her org, what are we doing really well in your mind that we need to keep doing? And that we, others should know?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, am I on?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: You're on.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: All right. So I think that the things we are doing really well is we're, as new folks come in and, you know, we reach out. And we're really starting to work well across organizations. So a lot of the work I have done, I'm within human health and performance. But I've actually been with Astromaterials Research. So across orgs we're really working together. And then another thing we're trying to really do, and I think NASA's doing a great job of this is really communicating to the public what we're doing. So using social media. Using things to really communicate the great things going on here at NASA. All the way from the science to the engineering to the missions. So putting a lot of focus, not just on astronauts, which is so cool. But focus on the stuff we're doing here every day in our labs and in our meetings and various things. It may not be as fun, but we're making that exciting. And we're communicating it to the public. So I see a lot of collaboration going on. A lot of communication. Things that have definitely, I think, gotten so much stronger since I've been here.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Estella, like to know what advice you have for women here at NASA.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm sorry?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: What advice you have for women here at NASA. Some advice you have for women here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Sorry.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: No, no.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm wearing hearing aids. Can anybody tell? Part of the perils of getting older. Advice for women. Get to know your organizations. Get to know where you are in the organization. And get to know anybody that wants to mentor you. I think it's still a day when we need, everybody needs a mentor. But I think seriously for women, we're still looking for role models and samples of what we want to become. And back in my day, in 1964 when I came here, that was really tough do. Now you have them all around you. I think there's lots of opportunities at NASA, the Johnson Space Center. I can't tell you what a great product I was for opportunity. Just look around you. Look for the opportunity. Get as prepared as you can. Get as many practice opportunities as you can. It's nice to do your job all the time. But give yourself a small percentage of time to go do other things that are other than your job. I think groups like the ERGs, things that are relevant to the Johnson Space Center and to the kind of work that we do, get involved with those. It's great to do a great job. But those involvements will also help you do a better job.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Dianne, I want to turn to you next. You arrived here sort of the end of the Mercury program. And been here through Gemini. And Apollo. Shuttle. ISS. A really distinguished career. An amazing body of work. You also have seen and experienced a significant number of highs and lows in your time here. Obviously some of the great highs of the Apollo landing and return. And shuttle flights. Also some significant lows in the Apollo 1 fire. And the Challenger and Columbia accidents. When you reflect back on that, can you talk about how you feel that those have really impacted the culture here at JSC. And I'd also like to hear about how you feel like they impacted you personally.  Dianne Milner: Actually, of course, starting back with, I came at the end of Mercury. So, of course, we had never put a human on a booster into space. So that was a stepping stone. We came to Gemini and, gosh, what we learned from Gemini almost losing a vehicle. But attitude control and the, we learned we needed to learn EVA skills. So we came back here and built pools to teach the astronauts. But then the Apollo 1 fire I think was most devastating to me because it was a realization that we can lose precious crew in a flight test on the pad. And not in orbit, you know. So that came home. There was so many things that had to be redone on the command module then. I was told it was almost redesigned. Specifically, no, but no one knew we couldn't use pure oxygen. So then, as we go on, we're learning from our mistakes. We didn't have a lot to work with. If you can imagine no computers. No e-mails. And nothing but short of slide rules and maybe there was a mainframe computer that would now be the size of what's on your desk now. But as we came on, we had, again, lots of success through the station and the shuttle program. And then we had to learn what, you know, we learned on Challenger. So as far as the culture, we went on. We moved on, but we learned. At the precious loss of lives, but we did learn.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Glad to hear that. Mary, also you have seen an amazing amount as well. You were working in the SPAN Room. Which is the spacecraft analysis room for those of you who don't know in the Apollo program mission control office. And you were here from Apollo 7 through 11. Can you talk about some of your most memorable experiences from that time. And I know you mentioned getting here right after Apollo 1. So there was probably quite a change in the pace and things to through that time.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Change in pace.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Well, that as well from, you know, beginning to the end of the Apollo program. And just whatever memorable experiences you'd like to highlight for us in that time for you.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. And just a small correction. When I came on board, I was, got a position in Dave Lang’s directorate, which was Procurement. But then I was assigned to the Apollo program office to work the SPAN Room during missions. Which was very, very exciting. Because you work during the day. You got off at 5:00, and you reported about 6:00. And you got off about 2:00. And then you reported at 8:30 again in the morning. But the most memorable of all of the missions that I did help support would be Apollo 11. When it was kind of new with the president talking to, whoever the president was at the time. Talking from the control center to the astronauts once they were wherever they were. And with 11, when they landed on the moon, of course, President Nixon was our president at that time. And the SPAN Room is a small room off of the control center where a lot of anomalies are taking place. Engineers are in there. Different staff members. And I was the secretarial support for that area at that time. And everybody had gone because, of course, we had landed. And they were waiting for, you know, the first step and that sort of thing. So I was by myself in the SPAN Room. And the phone rang. And when I answered it appropriately like you should, this gentleman was very excited. And said he had to get into the control center. That his calls were not going through. And wanted to know if I knew of some way that he could do that. And so I asked him his name as we would as secretaries. And he said, I'm the president. And I said, yes, sir, but of which company are you the president? So that kind of traveled real quick. When I, and there was nobody there. So I had to put him on hold. So I said, could you please hold a moment, and I will find out what we need to do. So when I came out of the SPAN Room and the control center at that time had little alleyways, I guess, that were going. And at the very end where people couldn't get in was all of the news media. So it came out, secretary puts president on hold. So we get into the control center, and I get him transferred. And all of that was really, really good and became very exciting. And everything went well. Just like what they were mentioning. And with every launch there is that anticipation. Because of what had happened before that we were vulnerable in some ways. But we had the best of the best working on everything. And the next thing would have been Apollo 13. And when you, you've all seen the movie, I'm sure. You've all been part of that whole experience. My husband was Lynn Dunseith. And he was director over computer systems at that time. And when all of that came about where they showed the going into the back room or side room. And saying this is what they have in the LEM. How are we going to get them home? And so that was exciting for my children to know that dad new how all of that happened. Now, we have five children. And they learned more about Lynn at his funeral than they ever knew when he was alive. Because engineers, they didn't talk about their job. They were top secret situations. And so they knew he worked at NASA. They knew they could come on a tour. But that was exciting for all of us. And I was so glad to get to experience all of that. And then ending with, I stayed on after Apollo. But the, ending with Gene Cernan's flight was a big one for me. He was such a personal, all the astronauts were personal and kind to us. But, you know, sometimes you just kind of get with somebody that you can really sit and talk. Have coffee or do whatever. And not feel that you, you're not, that you should be staunch so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Can you say a little more, Mary, about what it was like to be a woman in the mission control oort cloud at the time running around.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, being a woman in mission control for me was pretty exciting. I'm a woman who likes doors opened. I like being treated respectfully. And I like, I appreciated my, whatever you would call it, if you would call it my place. I was a secretary. Very proud secretary. I wouldn't mind if I served you coffee or a Estella coffee or anybody else in this room coffee. But we had a job to do, and we knew what we needed to do. And it was exciting. And I probably could have gone further in my career. All of my friends did. Estella was a secretary with me. Several of these ladies on this front row were secretaries with me. But I chose to go home and raise children. And so all of it's been great. And God put us where we needed to be, and he's been blessing us ever since.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Speaking of Estella, I'd like to know how you feel the work of equal opportunity has changed? And I'd love to hear about how it changed throughout your career as the director of the office when you were here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: You know, equal opportunity came about legally through affirmative action laws and all of that. But here at Johnson, we could see the movement already beginning. Now, most of us who were female were secretaries. I can count on one hand how many technical women there were. And recently Teresa Sullivan and I had an experience where \"LA Times\" was looking to interview technical women of Apollo era. And I think we found one, okay. There were others, but that we had tracked, we found one. On the other hand, we had the 60s chicks. And I'd like to ask them to stand please. Those of you who were part of our 60s chicks.  [ Applause ]  These were, we were all women who were supporting the program. And like Mary said, we were doing whatever it took to do. Nobody asked questions. We just did it. And I tell you what, we were very good at what we did. So, you know, whatever you do, just be good at it. But as far as equal opportunity, you know, through my 40 years at the Johnson Space Center, I saw the movement get wider and wider and wider. And it came about mostly because now we had women for the technical side of JSC here. We had women who were going to college to get degrees, STEM-related degrees, okay. Early on there were not that many women going into STEM degrees. And I know that NASA and lots of other industry were very much involved with making sure that we had that reach out to the community. To make sure that women were getting interested and going into STEM-related fields. Once that happened, and I was on the astronaut selection board in 1979, '80. I can remember still we had just trickles of women who were qualified to become astronauts even then, okay. However, through the years, and I'll make this an example with Eileen Collins. We were looking for, in the astronaut selection, we were looking for women pilots, okay. If anybody knows about the qualifications for pilot, you kind of have to go, you can't rent a jet and go get that kind of practice, okay. So you kind of had to be in the test pilot school in the military, all right. So women were not allowed, until I think 1972, into test pilot school, okay. Eileen Collins was one of those who was allowed. And eventually a few years later she became our first female pilot astronaut, okay. That's kind of how it was happening. At the Johnson Space Center, I could see that very, very well moving on. And that's because I came here in 1964, when you can count the women in one hand who were technical. You could count the minorities on one hand who were at Johnson. And little by little we began to reach out to the community. I think 35 of my 40 years were part of, were involved in outreach. So now that I teach at the University of Houston and I look at my classrooms, I see that it worked. The outreach of other, not just NASA, but other communities going out there and making sure that we start at the bottom and start little kids getting interested. And not wait to the last minute and then wonder where we're going to get qualified people. So I think the country has done a great job as far as making sure that we get people involved at the bottom in education. And then in the job market, you get, you know, when I was director of equal opportunity, we used something called the relevant civilian labor force to measure who, how many we should have in each category. And that worked because you kind of go to the population that can do the job here. And that's where we draw from. You can't draw from the general population because they don't have the qualifications to do the kind of work that we do here. It's a very, and I'm sure you've experienced this. But it seemed to be a more quantitative way of going out and looking for folks. Making sure that, number one, we were involved with the development of the people that we wanted to recruit here. And, number two, once they get here, make sure that we develop people constantly over and over, giving them practice. And that's why I teach human resource development now. Because I think that is the way to do people, to get people qualified better. And to really be a part of the organization.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, I think that's wonderful. Especially since onboarding is a really significant part of all of our employer resource group's charters. Not only to bring folks on, but also to onboard them into what it's like to be working here at the space center. And how we can help support them going forward. So following on what you said, Ashley, I'd love to hear also from you in your role with the equal opportunity diversity. Talk to us a little bit about how your role has really shaped what's been going on here in the last few years. We now have inclusive innovation as part of our, you know, core tenets. And we've been doing so much work in that area. I'd love to know how you think going forward our workforce might need to adapt to what our challenges are coming at us with our new programs and everything else.  Ashley White: So this is an honor to share the stage. We see her picture in our office as a, literally every day. So when I walked in, I said, oh, hi. Because we are standing on the shoulders of such great work. So we are so appreciative. And this is the work that we are charged to continue to do. We look at the people, the policies and the procedure that are in place to make sure that it's a workplace free of discrimination. Retaliation. And harassment. So one of those aspects that we're doing to help is training. In fact, before I came here I was in the Gilruth talking to about 50 or 60 of our education interns. Making sure that they know what their rights and responsibilities are. Every year we do training through human resource management to managers so that everybody understands what their roles and responsibilities are. We take very seriously conflict resolution and mediation. Because unsolved conflict brews under the surface. And it becomes much more about than just that one thing. And it impacts and can really mess up an organization if it's not handled at the lowest level. You already spoke about the great work that the ERGs are doing. Our role in our office is to give them the maximum support possible to help them dream bigger dreams. You want to go where? Okay, well, let's figure out how we can do that. You want to do a panel? Okay, well, let's see how, what resources that we have within our office to do so. But we focus on reasonable accommodations. That is huge to make sure every single employee here understands their worth. And that they are valued. They are opinions matter. And if they need some additional assistance, our office is here in coordination with the center to make sure they have the resources they need.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So talk to us a little bit about the next few years. We're going to have potentially a large ramp up in work. And deadlines. And what are some of the things that we need to be thinking about to support our workforce if we hire on, you know, a great deal more folks? Do we do temporary? Or however that looks. We're going to need all hands on deck to get this done. Are there things that you think we need to be putting in place now to really support that? Or what are some things that you think ahead we should consider?  Ashley White: We must always remember our JSC expected behaviors. Because regardless of what the work is or the pace of the work. If we don't respect one another. If we don't have tenets of teamwork and loyalty and integrity. We won't reach that next level. I think it's very important that we are respective and respectful of age. We had an employee last week retire with 54 years of experience. But we also have employees here with less than six months. So making sure that it's an equal playing field. That people feel like their opinions are valued. That they're heard. And especially in a safety culture, if you're like, well, no, I just got here. I can't say anything. That doesn't help us continue to improve. So I think, as we look ahead, making sure that we really use diversity and inclusion. Not just as tag words, but really tenets of who we stand for as JSC.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you so much for that. I agree wholeheartedly. And thinking on words to the future, I want to, Sarah, talk to you a little bit about your work. So you were part of the team that launched the first DNA sequencer to the ISS. Which is incredibly exciting. Congratulations. And that, also along with some of your other studies, have lead to the identification of some microbiomes that have been cultured off Earth. Which is also very exciting. So can you share with us the significance of your work. And also I'd love for you to tell us where you think the future of this work is headed. Especially as we try to get more Earth independent.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so I think that we, in the life sciences, we look at ISS as this incredible platform for research. And an opportunity for us to learn. And for so long we've kind of operated in this world of, you know, we grow, we expose whatever model organism or whatever it is to the conditions of space flight. And then we bring the samples back to Earth for analysis. So what the team I'm on and the work we're doing is really to try to take really our labs and put them on ISS to give us the capability to do that analysis on board. And for me specifically as a micro biologist, we launched the DNA sequencer just to show that it would work. But then we really tried take it to the next level with, some of our routine work that we do is checking up on what the environment looks like microbially. And so actually having astronaut Peggy Whitson take some of these things that we routinely culture. Open them and identify them all on board the ISS. Which is a first. And we've never been able to do that. So we're really excited just to show that capability that we have, you know, we can do this stuff on Earth. We don't need to always fix or freeze a sample and bring it back. We can do it all in space. And I really think that this is going to be critical as we go forward. So as we look beyond ISS and we look towards exploration class missions, we need technologies that can give us real-time input on the environment that the crew's exposed to. Crew health themselves. Every aspect of that. And so I really think that these technologies will be absolutely critical. And that's the work we're continuing to try to do is to take it even one step further. Make it even more simple. Go beyond microbes. We've started doing some human work. And looking at the way, you know, developing methods that we can use to maybe understand how astronauts are responding to different things. And so I think there's a lot of potential. And I'm just, I'm really excited because I see the work that my colleagues are doing in similar areas. And I just think, in terms of the science, we're getting back. And in terms of getting us ready to go beyond ISS, we're really getting there. So which is a really exciting time. And I think it's, we're all eager. And we're all excited to, those of us that weren't around during Apollo. We're all just so excited to be able to be a part of that as we go forward with Artemis. And, you know, we're excited for our technologies and our methods to make an impact there. And I really think they will. And I think that we have a lot of good work still to do. But we've done a lot to really show that we have these capabilities now.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So interestingly, in our world we talk a lot about astronaut health, as you said. And we have, you know, quarantine has always been something that after the Apollo missions was, you know, taken very seriously. And I know some of the conferences in the human health and performance world, lately we've been talking a lot about planetary and protection. And can you speak a little bit about how important that is as we're learning more about areas in your field of study. What the responsibility is that we have as we go and explore. And kind of how we can really relate that back to plan those designs for that.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so within that kind of, within the realm of planetary protection, there's always two things we're worried about. And I would say, when we went to the moon the first time, we weren't so, we weren't as worried about contaminating the moon. We were worried about back-contaminating Earth. Which was why the quarantine of the astronauts over in the old building 37 was so important. Because, if there was some andromeda strain, we wanted to make sure we weren't exposing, you know, population of Earth to this. So NASA took that very seriously. And so that's, you know, there's great stories. If you're interested, find me later. I know them all. So it was a really exciting time. But now, as we look, we're still always going to be worried about that, as we haven't explored Mars and some of these other bodies. Enceladus. Europa. That, you know, many scientists are excited might harbor life. So really there's those two aspects of, one, not bringing anything back. And, two, how much we're contaminating it. We are walking microbiomes. We have all these bacteria that are associated with us. That, you know, we don't want to, if there is life there, we don't want to impact that life on that planet or moon. So really having the capability to get a good baseline to understand what we have in us and on us. What's in and on our spacecraft vehicles. On the space suits. Every little aspect of this is really important to establish that baseline so we can understand what we are, you know, contributing potentially to another surface. And so that, you know, then, if we do find something, is that novel or is that something we put there? So, and, again, always monitoring what we're bringing back with us. So those are the two big areas we're concerned with. And we're, with the technology we have now with the DNA sequencer and the methods we've developed, we're really excited. We're working with all of our international partners to really kind of form one method that we can all use to really start piecing all this together. So all of that's in work. And I think the next few years are going to be really exciting as we have the technologies to both screen for life beyond Earth. And measure what we're taking with us beyond Earth.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. I appreciate that perspective of sort of the big picture of some reasons of why we go. And what we're thinking of, you know, when we pick our head up and go where are we aiming for? What are we trying to accomplish? And to that end also, Dianne and I were talking earlier. I'd love to hear, Dianne, your thoughts. You alluded to sort of the, we talked a little bit about the pace of the work that was happening around the Apollo time. And we're being tasked for the next four years to do something very similar. And, you know, the methods you mentioned were different than they are now. Can you talk about how you think we might be able to face that challenge of this quick turnaround. But you also have some great perspective on what the pace in life was like here beforehand.  Dianne Milner: Well, actually it was a very heated rush, pressure to get to the moon for Apollo 11. And the technologies that we had to work with back then were really primitive compared to what we have now. So I think personally going to the moon in 2024 is going to be a piece of cake. But realistically I think we have the technology. The brilliance in our community and workforce here to make sure it's done right. And it's going to be right before we go. We have certainly a deadline, but I don't feel the pressure, unless it's right, that we'll go before then. But I think we'll get there definitely. Maybe not exactly 2024, but close to it.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. So I want to pause for a second and just remind that you in about five minutes we're going to go to our Slido questions. So if haven't already contributed and you would like to, please do that. And, Jessica, I'm just going to confirm with you, I'm going to do one more round. And then you're going to toss it over to Slido for the, up to the end; right? So, okay, great. So I kind of wanted to go down the road this time, since we've got about five minutes before we throw it out to the audience. I would love to hear from each of you what nugget do you want to leave this audience with, this group? This group that's really intent on learning from how we've done things and where we need to be going forward. What is any nugget that you would like to share with this group? Love to hear it? Mary, do you want to start us off?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, I guess what I'd like to say is for those of you who are still working here and those of you who are retired from here. It's the greatest opportunity that we had or will have. We all touch somebody. And whether it's mentoring a young person that's on their way up. Just knowing that this is it. This is the greatest place to start your career and end your career here, if that need be. But the people that you meet, the mentors that you have. And I don't believe there's one NASA employee or past employee that you couldn't reach out to if you had a question. We are all available. And we all want to go in the same direction. So that's the nugget I would leave.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Ashley.  Ashley White: So the best piece of advice I got, I actually got recently. Couple years ago I was struggling with trying to balance work and caring for an ailing grandmother. And my manager said to me, be your best wherever you are. So if you're at work, fully commitment to being at work. If you're in the hospital, fully commitment to caring for her. And that's freed me from trying to be everything to every person at all times. And I wasn't giving anybody my best. So if I could give you what was given to me, be your best wherever you are. And if that means, excuse me, having to have a pep rally of one before a meeting. If that means sitting in your car and getting your mind right before you walk into work. Do whatever it is that you need to do to make sure you're your best wherever you are.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Dang, that's a tough one. Because I have so much advice I could give you guys. So much. Yeah, lots. But I think, you know, and I go back to 1964. When I came in 1964, it was October 19th, 1964. Memorable day for me. The Johnson Space Center the Manned Spacecraft Center had just opened the gates. So there were a few buildings. It was me coming here and saying, oh, my God, what have I done? Because, when I applied for the government service and I passed, this was just a few months after I became a naturalized citizen. Because I was born in Mexico. And I passed a civil service exam. And I came here. I had three interviews. And I went home and told my mom and my dad that I had a job offer. In fact, I had three job offers. And my mom and dad said, you're not going there. I said, why not? It's too far to drive. You're not going there. Because we lived on the other side of the Pierce Elevated now. And my, and I said, yes, I am. And, you know, Mexican culture, very, very strict. And that was a very rebellious thing for me to do is to say, yes, I am. And my mom says, you don't have a car. I said, I'll buy one. So I bought a car. I was here. Three months later my dad talked about me as if I owned the Johnson – or the Manned Spacecraft Center. He was so proud. He was so proud. But coming here was so scary. Because there weren't a lot of people that looked like me. And I wasn't even really conscious of that. It was just that it was mostly white men. And they were mostly wearing white shirts with black ties and pocket protectors. They really did wear those, okay. And, but what I found was that, because I was good at what I was supposed to be doing, they all thought I was great. And because I started as a secretary and I got my training in high school, Jeff Davis High School here in town. They thought, the guys that I worked with, there were 21 of them. And it was Building 13, Structures and Mechanics Division in Building, yeah, 13. They thought I was fascinating because I could type 98 words a minute, okay. I could take shorthand at 80 words a minute, you know. And I think a lot of us could do that in that time, okay. So I think the best advice I can give you is do the job you're supposed to be doing and do the best at it. And in the meantime pick up some additional skills for the next job that you're going to. But I met a few people along the way who aspired for other things, but they weren't really doing what they were supposed to be doing already. So my advice is look at your job description. What are you supposed to be doing? I mentioned the mentoring already. You mentioned respect and dignity. Those go a long way. So I think this is a wonderful home. Like Mary says, and I think all of us would agree here, it's a wonderful place to work. If somebody had told me in 1963, when I graduated from high school, that I was going to make a career out of here. I would have said, NASA, what's that? Because I did not know what NASA was until my yearbook featured the original seven astronauts. And then I knew what NASA was. And I made it home here. It's like a family. Mary mentioned the family a few times. It is a family. Find out who the members are. Find out what works and what doesn't work. Look at the people around you. What do they do? Who do you want to become like? You have so many goods examples. There's historical examples. There's current examples. And I marvel at this young lady [indicates Sarah Wallace] and what she's doing. I wish I had done that. So I really could go on and on about all the wonderful things here. But just enjoy what you do. And consider yourself privileged because you really are.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Well, that's hard to follow. But I just want to build on what Estella said. It's the, if you have passion, and anyone who knows me knows I, absolutely incredibly passionate about what I do. But it's, don't take no for an answer. It's, I have been told no so many times about an idea. Or, you know, something simple to something big. But I don't let that stop me. And you just, if you have an idea that you really believe in. And you're really passionate about. And you really see the benefit. Just keep pushing. And, you know, there's been times I've been concerned is it my age? Is it the way I look? What is it that I'm, you know, being told no about? And you don't stop to where then, you know, you, I feel like our work now is having a huge impact. And what we're doing is really causing change. And that's so great. Because I look back to a couple years ago, and it was just like dead end after dead end. So just don't stop. If you're passionate, just keep going. And somebody will finally, you know, you'll get somebody to kind of buy into what you're saying. And hopefully, you know, we can all continue to move mountains and get us closer to our next goal.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Love that. Thank you. Dianne, you want to bring us home?  Dianne Milner: Yes. I was just thinking out at Rice Stadium there's a big billboard that says, be the best that you can be. And I think that more or less sums it up. If you're bored, if you're not interested, change jobs. Find something else. But be happy with what you're doing. Be involved with others that you're working with. And you have a challenge out there to satisfy yourself and be successful. Follow that dream, that hope, and you will be.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. That's a beautiful way to end. Thank you so much for all of your participation. I think we're going to throw it back over to our moderators to do the questions. So let me just give you all a round of applause from myself personally. Thank you for answering my questions and for talking to us today. Thank you so much.  [ Applause ]  Question: So this first question is for Sarah and Ashley. What does equality at JSC and NASA mean to you? Have we achieved it? Or what more should we strive for?  Ashley White: You said equality?  Question: Yes, equality.  Ashley White: What does it mean to me? And has it been achieved at NASA? It is an everlasting goal. Because just when you think you have reached it, the marks change. We are, diversity is not a one-time fix. The same thing with equality. But it's making sure that we have a fair and balanced workforce. And that every opportunity is equal to everyone. So for me I think JSC is striving. We are striving to be what we call on our side of the house an EEO model center. And that is where we put practices and plans in place to ensure that we're continuing to improve. Because, as we have all these new challenges, the same thing arises on the mission support side to make sure that we don't stay stagnant. What worked 50 years ago has changed. And being open to embracing the newness of people. The newness of ideas. The diversity of thought.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: And I agree completely. And I would say there's always that, when, you know, when I was talking about, you know, being told no or something. There's always that little ugliness in the back of your mind. It's like is it because, what is it? Is it because I'm female? Is it because I'm young? I dye my hair blond, what is it? And so it's, there's always that, but I think we are moving past that. And equality for me is, you know, anyone of us can be taken as seriously as, you know, a senior or male who's been here for a much longer time. And I think we are getting there. But as you're saying, it's always, you know, I feel like we always need to be striving to make sure we're keeping to progress in that way. And listen to everybody's ideas and everybody's thoughts regardless, you know, of their background. And, you know, I think that JSC is doing a phenomenal job of this. And we are keeping it very at the front of our mind. And I think we'll continue to do so.  Question: Next question for our Apollo guests. What traits do you see that are common to all women who have been successful here at JSC?  Dianne Milner: I think loyalty and ambition. You know, I've seen those two outstanding traits. Willingness to work. To get their goals, what they want to do.  Mary Dunseith Henry: I'll just mirror what she said as well. But I think Estella could probably answer this question very well.  [ Laughter ]  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Mary used to do that to me all the time when we worked together. She's still doing it. What traits? I looked at women like Marilyn Bocktine. Some of you remember Marilyn. Virginia Hughes, okay. She was federal women's program manager. Carolyn Huntoon. Who was kind of like way up there because she was a scientist. And, you know, she one of the guys too. I think what I wanted to become was one of the guys, but still be a female. You know, what I'm saying? I mean, I liked the world that the men seemed to have built. And, you know, I kind of eased my way into it by doing what I said earlier. Mimicking some of the women that were my role models like Marilyn Bocktine. One of the things that I realized early on is, if I looked for a role model that looked like me, I couldn't find one back then, okay. So I looked for a role model that was in the same discipline as I was. And Marilyn was secretary to George Low, okay. Kind of Apollo father kind of guy. But she was so fun. Virginia Hughes was so fun. So look for those traits that you think are important to you and that you can imitate or become like. But also look for the traits that the guys have, okay. I had bosses like George Abbey. One day I want to become just like him when I grow up, okay. I had bosses like Cliff Charlesworth, Apollo 11 and Apollo 13. Who everybody said was not very friendly. But he was soft as a pussycat. He was just such a nice guy when I finally found out who he was. I had bosses like John Young. Who was exciting to be around just because of what he had done. But I picked up traits from all of them, not just women, okay. Because I think it's important to blend the characteristics of those people who make this place what it is. So if you kind of look too much for something that you're really comfortable with, then you'll never change and get there. So look for things that you're not comfortable with, I think.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Okay.  Question: So our last question for today. Did any of you have a male mentor or supporter who encouraged you in your careers? If so, can you talk about your advice or their advice?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Can you repeat that question.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Did any of you have you a male mentor in your career that supported you? And can you tell us a little bit about their advice to you? Is that, did I catch that right? Okay.  Mary Dunseith Henry: So a male mentor for me would have been John Zarcaro. And he was very good at what he did. And he was a very kind man. And he always supported you when you got something bad. In those days our letters didn't just go out, we typed them. And we had to make carbon copies. We didn't have corrective tape or anything like that. So we had a woman, Estella, what was her name? You know who I'm talking about. [Laughter] Y’all know who I'm talking about. What was her name?  Audience: Lee Brubaker.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Brubaker.  Mary Dunseith Henry: No.  Audience: Iris Garner.  Audience: Betsy.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. I guess I don't know. My letters from the ninth floor went through Lee Brubaker. That's who my letters went through. And she was a really sweet person. Kind of like what Estella said about Cliff Charlesworth. When we came to work, she went to work for Charlesworth. And I went to work for Zarcaro. I was afraid of Charlesworth until you got to know him. But she had the reputation of carrying a big stick. And you didn't want your letter that needed to be out by five o'clock and she wasn't going to get it till 3:00 along with the other 300 letters that she was getting from all of the other secretarial staff. So that's kind of where I'm coming from.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Male mentor, does anybody want to share?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah. So the NASA microbiologist before me, Duane Pierson and Mark Ott, who I look up to both tremendously. But Mark was, has actually been a mentor for me since I was in graduate school. And he always, you know, coming back to what you're passionate about and your work ethic. He always told me, you know, cream rises to the top. So if you work hard, while there are days here that it seems like nothing is working. And there's politics and there's other things involved. At the end, if you continue to work hard and do good work, it will be seen. And you will be recognized for it. And so that has absolutely held true for me. So the times where, you know, he's been very good about when things have been rough, you know, in the end, if you work hard, things will come through.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Actually, am I allowed to break protocol and answer this question?  Question: Yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, okay. So I had two fantastic male mentors. The first one was Walt Guy. Who some of you know and have worked with. He was the head of the engineering robotics department when I was first there. And he was sort of a silent supporter. I never knew he was championing me from behind the scenes, but he was the entire time. And the advice I got with working for Walt, if you know Walt and you've done disk assessments, he's very green. He likes the data. And he liked to know all the information before making a decision. And so the advice I got was, you're going to go up in front of Walt, make sure you know. And if he asks you a question you don't know the answer, tell them you don't know the answer. And if you do know the answer and you want to, you know, go back and forth, go back and forth. Because you know, and you've got the data to back it up. And that was the best advice I ever got working with him. And as a result, we formed this very trusting bond. He knew he could come to me, and I would tell it like it was. Or I'd say, I have no idea. But that's a darn good question. I'm going to go find out. So that was a piece of advice that I really took to heart. Especially working with people who just like the facts. The other mentor that had was Steve Altemus. Who was the head of Engineering Directorate. And I was up as an executive intern for a few months. And I had been here about seven or eight years. And he says to me one day, Jen, what do you want to do? What do you want to do here? I was like, nobody's ever asked me that before. I think when I got here I thought, okay, I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. And he was the first person who said, what do you want to do? And I told him. I said, I think it's really important that we get humans integrated into the spacecraft from the beginning. And he said, I think that's great. So he asked me to go work constellation from the engineering perspective with the human systems group and partner with the human health and performance, that then was space lab sciences. And we made a great team and did that work going forward. And he, and, you know, I heard this phrase from him. You know, no one's going to care about your career more than you do. And so it's great to have mentors and leads and advices, but you've got to take that initiative. And he switched the bit in my mind that I was responsible for making things happen. And so I really appreciate that. And I guess the only other nugget I would leave all of our panelists with is I very much value showing up with authenticity. I think we bring our whole selves to work. It sounds trite sometimes, but it's really true when you work from a place, an authentic place. And I think all of you have touched on that in your stories. I've heard that. That nugget is, when you come through and you are your authentic self. And you're showing up that way, that's what creates that community and that bond and that opportunity for everyone. So thanks for letting me break protocol and answer. Because I've only got a week or two, so I got to get it out now. Thank you all so much for your participation. And I think we're going to hand it back to Vanessa and Jessica for wrapping up.  Vanessa Wyche: Awesome. What a wonderful, wonderful panel. Thank you.  [ Applause ]  [ Music ]  Host: All right then. That's a really interesting discussion, Jessica. Kudos to WELL for getting these women to share their thoughts on the panel. And letting us share it with this wider audience.  Jessica Vos: Oh, gosh, thank you so much for the opportunity.

            "description": "Dan Huot (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 82, Resident Extreme.  I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today.  If you're new to the show, we bring in NASA experts to talk about all different parts of our space agency.  And sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to talk about their story.  So today we're talking with Christina Hammock Koch.  She's a U.S. Astronaut who is about to launch to the International Space Station in March 2019 for her very first space flight.  We talked about her education study in electrical engineering in physics.  Her time at NASA Goddard in Maryland studying astrophysics and her experience living in some of the most remote places in the world including Alaska, Greenland, American Samoa, and Antarctica.  She's no joke.  So with no further delay let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Christina Koch.  Enjoy.   [ Music ]   Host: I'm glad we could pull you out of the final months of training for a couple of minutes.  I know life has got to be hectic.  What have you been up to lately?   Christina Koch: Yeah, thanks.  Thanks for having me.  It's my honor to be here.  I have been back in Houston training for about three weeks now and when I'm back here I'm mainly working on space station systems training, space station emergency training, track and capture training for grabbing the visiting cargo vehicles when they come using the robotic arm and training on medical stuff.  So making sure I can help out my crewmates when the time comes.   Host: So at this point you're so close to launch, do you just have a calendar on the wall where you're x'ing off the days and then there's one written like \"Launch\", circled real big?   Christina Koch: Mentally I do have a little bit of a list in my head.  Yesterday I did happen to notice that it was exactly one month until I leave for Russia for the last time for the launch.  So it's an exciting time and yes, we have a Google Calendar actually with the date marked.   Host: And I should mention we have Bob Koch with us today.  He's going to be hanging out.    Bob Koch: How are you guys doing?   Host: We'll get with you Bob in a little bit.  I want to kind of go through Christina's early life a little bit.  We want to see kind of the Behind the Music, Behind the Astronaut.  How you got to where you are today.  So where were you born?   Christina Koch: I was actually born in western Michigan, in Grand Rapids Michigan, and I grew up in eastern North Carolina.   Host: OK, and so you kind of moved around all over the place.  Did you live anywhere else?   Christina Koch: Actually growing up I was pretty stable.  We lived in the same town in North Carolina for many years and it wasn't until I graduated from college that I started kind of exploring the world a little bit more.   Host: And I was just looking through just some of the places you have been.  You have been everywhere.  You've been kind of all over the place.  So where did you go to college?   Christina Koch: Went to college in North Carolina, North Carolina State University and that's in Raleigh.   Host: OK, so you kind of stuck close to home and then after that it was just like, you know, completely out the window.  You're going everywhere.  What was -- do you remember like the first time you left the country?   Christina Koch: I do, actually the first time I ever left the country I was I went to Australia to visit an aunt that lived there.  So that was definitely eye opening.  And then I saved up my money in college and I took a vacation to Scotland during one of my summers.  And then after that my next trip I think was my study abroad in Ghana and West Africa.   Host: What were you studying in college?  Everybody we always hear the same questions, you know, what did you do to become the astronaut?  What should I go study to kind of be in your shoes?  What did Christina do?   Christina Koch: Well, I was really passionate about physics and electrical engineering so that's what I studied.  I think everyone should follow sort of what they love, not necessarily what they think, you know, if you want to be an astronaut not necessarily what you think NASA wants you to study but definitely what you love.  And that's what drew me in.  I chose physics because I love the theoretical aspects of kind of how the world works and all the cool sounding things like quantum mechanics.  And then engineering was just a way to kind of bring it down to Earth and get a chance to design things, being in a lab bench, makes things with my hands.  You know, I grown up working with my dad in his shed and I just loved tools and creating things.   Host: Was there any kind of moment you think in your life, you know, the young kid sees the guitar in the window and grows up to the be the rock star.  Anything that you did that kind of laid the path to be an astronaut?   Christina Koch: You know, I was fascinated with space from the time I was really young.  I always used to say I liked things that I made me feel small.  I liked the ocean.  I liked the night sky.  And so that sort of adventurist, exploration, kind of interest led me to want to sort of explore the world.  I did a lot of reading travel magazines as a kid.  But I don't know exactly when the moment happened because even in my small town there weren't even necessarily engineers that I ever saw.  So I'm not really sure how I got it into my head.  It might have been a trip down to Kennedy Space Center with the family, but I just know it's always been there.  And you know the choice to be an engineer, like I said, was just it sounded really awesome to me.  Not necessarily because I even knew what that meant when I was, you know, 16 years old and making those decisions.  But based on what I was good at and what I liked to do, it definitely was the right path for me.   Host: So you got the engineering bug early on and you did that throughout college.  And so you said you did a study abroad and you were in Ghana.  What was that like?   Christina Koch: Ghana was an incredible experience.  It gave me a lot of perspective.  It taught me that what I had come to know as normal wasn't necessarily normal everywhere.   Host: Very different than North Carolina.   Christina Koch: Very, yes.  I did a lot of African studies.  I got to have a drumming class underneath a tree behind a certain building.  So those were my classrooms when I was there and it was an amazing experience.  I traveled a lot there.  I learned a lot about myself and I learned to be comfortable in situations that weren't, you know, what I was used to.  There was no Walmart to go to there when you needed something.  You had to kind of make it happen.  Transportation, getting around, everything was different.  And learning to adapt and learning that I could adapt was a real confidence builder as well as a perspective builder.   Host: And then so you go through that and then you're done with college.  What was kind of the first step out of college?  So when you were in college did you know what you were going to do when you graduated college?  Because I know so many people who are just like, \"I don't know what I'm going to be when I grow up.\"   Christina Koch: I was lucky.  I knew I wanted to work at NASA and I had had a summer internship in a group at Goddard Space Flight Center doing high-energy astrophysics instrument design.  And I was fortunate enough that when I graduated they wanted to hire me full time.  So I went to work there and from that point on my career just, that was sort of the launching point.  I also had had an interest all along in Antarctica.  I had posters of Antarctica up on my walls when I was a kid and it was again, just in this vain of exploration and science on the frontiers.  And so after two years of my job as an engineer with NASA, I ended up searching out and getting lucky enough to land a job working at the South Pole for a year.  So that was kind of the first two years post college for me.   Host: So this is something that kind of always blows me away at NASA.  I have a very vivid memory of being over in Kazakhstan one time for a Soyuz Mission and were' just sitting there eating breakfast and four of the six people at the table had been to Antarctica.  And I don't know about a lot of you but it's very rare to meet even one person in your lifetime that's been to Antarctica and we seem to have a whole bunch of them hear at NASA.   What is it about Antarctica that kind of draws people to it and what is the parallel that we keep seeing with what we do with space flight?   Christina Koch: There are many parallels and I agree there's a lot of Antarctic folks here.  I would say kind of just the harshness of the environment and the mental and physical kind of fortitude that it takes to be successful somewhere like that, coupled with the science that you can do in that unique environment.  So it's really a great analog.  There are scientific reasons why it's an analog.  For example, people looking at how to build a Lander for Europa go and test it in certain parts of Antarctica in the frozen, you know, under frozen ice lakes there.  So there's physical analogs and then there's just, you know, the mental analogs as well.   Host: Do you guys have like an Antarctic book club here at NASA?  I mean there's enough of you.   Christina Koch: There is enough of us, no we chat about it a lot.  No book club yet.  Good idea.   Host: So you're doing some engineering stuff and some -- where you doing any of the -- because you're also a physicist, where you doing any of the more high minded astrophysics work at NASA?   Christina Koch: You know, the jobs I had down there were similar to kind of the astronaut job where you're not the researcher running the research program, or you're not the principle investigator, but you're the person on the ground, the eyes and ears running the experiment and kind of having to know enough about it to be useful in that role and also to just enjoy tinkering and making things work in a harsh environment when they don't always want to work initially.  So I was what's called a research associate.  I also dealt with a lot of cryogenics.  The telescopes of the South Pole were cryogenics, actually, to have their detectors cold enough to detect the really faint signals that they're looking for.  So even a place as cold as the South Pole we still use cryogenics and that was a program I was in charge of.  So I ran geophysical labs for researchers that weren't there and just a really wide variety of different types of experiments.   Host: You couldn't just open the window, cool off the telescope?  It wasn't --   Christina Koch: No, our motto was \"South Pole cryo, when the South Pole just isn't cold enough.\"   Host: How cold did it need to be?   Christina Koch: Those experiments got down to like the temperatures of liquid helium, which would be like four degrees above absolute zero, so yeah, four kelvin.   Host: All right, so a little bit colder than it was outside.  Christina Koch: Yeah, a little bit colder than the minus 100 Fahrenheit on the station.   Host: [laughs] All right so after Antarctica where did the path take you?  Where were off to after that?  Hopefully somewhere warmer.   Christina Koch: Yeah, I didn't quite make it to somewhere warmer right away, but I did return to space science instrumentation.  I worked as a space scientist instrument designer at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University working on NASA missions.  So I had the opportunity to kind of do more team design of space science instruments, which was really exciting.  I had a couple launches.  I have an instrument that I was a part of team for at Jupiter right now, one orbing the Earth studying radiation.  And then after that the bug called again and I returned to remote science work and this time was able to kind of expand and incorporate work up in the Arctic.  So I got some seasons wintering in Greenland, as well as the northern coast of Alaska.  And then finally to another remote station that's in that same network of science bases that as in American Samoa.  Finally got somewhere warm.   Host: I was going to say so then you went to Greenland so you just kind of have thing for being in the middle of nowhere it seems.   Christina Koch: I do enjoy the challenges.  Like I talked about, small crews is always a really interesting environment.  Just learning how to thrive with a small group of people.  Getting to know people really well, having them feel like you're family and then getting to do really neat science all along, those challenges.  You know, and the seasonal, working seasonally, so having time off to do some of my outdoor hobbies, I'm between seasons working in those places.  The overall lifestyle, incorporating science and those opportunities was really great.   Host: Are there many outdoor hobbies you can do in Antarctica or Greenland?   Christina Koch: There are.  In many of the places there, obviously cross country skiing is one that comes to mind, but our jobs day to day are very very demanding.  So I talked about how I love rock climbing, well I used to get to climb towers to work on instruments at the top of these instrumentation towers and I loved soldering irons up towers and soldered in minus 40 degree weather fixing things, hanging off the tower with, you know, carabiner gear and things like that.  So just the job itself kind of scratched the itch of outdoor adventure.   Host: So this astronaut stuff is just going to be easy, right [laughing]?   Christina Koch: I don't know about that, no it's presented plenty challenges, plenty new challenges and opportunities.   Host: All right well we finally got you somewhere warm.  You're in American Samoa.  What were you doing there?   Christina Koch: I was working at another remote research base.  This particular network of bases was a climate research station famous for measuring what's called the Keeling Curve, so the C02 overall atmospheric rise of C02.  These climate stations have to be in remote places because they're designed to measure the baseline of our atmospheres.  So they can't be affected by, you know, human sources of any of these things that we're studying so --   Host: Cars driving down the street and stuff, yeah.   Christina Koch: Exactly, yeah.  So really remote places, so American Samoa is like maybe 500 miles south of Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific and there's prevailing winds there so we stuck, or NOAA suck a station on the kind of upwind end of the island and has been studying the climate there.   Host: And that's where you met Bob.   Christina Koch: It is.  I was very lucky I met Bob, my husband there.   Host: Bob, what were you doing there?   Bob Koch: I was working as a contractor for the government and I was head of the geospatial program for the Samoan Department of Commerce.  And so I was there on a two year contract, you know, similar type of mission trying to accomplish something somewhere unique and travel somewhere and do some interesting work.   Host: Do you remember how you guys met?  I don't know how personal we want to get but like did you guys -- were you climbing a carabiner and you happened to be, you know, next in line to come up with tools or something?   Christina Koch: Actually no, but it's funny you mention that because there is a funny story that happened later where Bob is a football fan, and I'm not necessarily a football fan but I am a rock climbing fan.  And there was a big Super Bowl party one day that I skipped to go rock climbing with the other rock-climbing rebel of our friend group.  So we didn't always necessarily do everything together, but we met at a Halloween party actually.   Bob Koch: Yeah, met at a Halloween party and Christina had worked on the most remote place of a remote island and on her commute to work, which as about like 45 minutes to an hour.   Christina Koch: Yes.   Bob Koch: Across the whole entire island.  She passed one of the best surf breaks on the island.  So as soon as I learned that I started asking her to send me videos or surf reports so I wouldn't have to drive an hour across the island to find out.   Christina Koch: Yes.   Bob Koch: And so we had to teach Christina how to calibrate her wave forecasting and wave reporting.   Christina Koch: Yeah, a new job duty of mine, not only monitoring the climate but monitoring of the swell, the surf state.  So yeah, I got lucky there.  I happened to work next to a surf break that Bob was interested in knowing more about.  So he had to keep in touch with me.   Host: Yeah, well what else is there to do when you're kind of out in the remotest places on planet Earth?   Christina Koch: So much to do in American Samoa.  Lots of outdoor adventure.  I mean --   Bob Koch: Well you would call it Peter Pan Island, right?   Christina Koch: Yeah, exactly.  It was a beautiful place where you can just imagine both mountains and the ocean available.  So a lot of paddling, hiking, scuba diving, surfing obviously.  I wasn't a surfer yet at that point but Bob was really big into the surfing.  So just tons of adventure.   Host: Well, then it became time for the ultimate of adventure, becoming an astronaut.  When did you frist decide?  I mean were you just kind of scrolling through the Internet some day and say, oh you know, I'll click on this job application and give that a shot.   Christina Koch: Right.  I had heard about the call for astronauts in 2009 but at that point I was working at the job still doing space science instrumentation at the Applied Physics Lab.  I felt, sort of looked at my collective experience and didn't feel like I was quite ready to present myself to this program that, you know, I had loved for so long.  I didn't feel like I quite accumulated the amount of experience I wanted to.  So I held off on applying that year.  But then in 2011, there was another call and again I looked at my accumulative experience and I thought, I'm ready, I'm ready to sit across from people at a table and tell them that I can contribute to this program.  So I was actually in Barrow Alaska by myself and you know, in the house working outside near the station I worked at there and got together my online application and hit Submit.  I was 500 miles north of the Arctic Circle at the time and I thought I would never hear anything back from them.  It was just, you know, I though that was it.   Host: And that was your -- you only applied once?   Christina Koch: That's correct.   Host: You were a first timer.   Christina Koch: Yes, I was very fortunate.   Host: A lot of astronauts have stories of perseverance of the NASA rejection letter.  So you, that extra experience obviously paid off.  And so you were selected in 2013 and you have been here ever since.  What's -- I mean, what's the astronaut life like?  Oh no, before we get to that I'm skipping ahead.  There's the all important call.   Christina Koch: Oh yes, the call.   Host: So what was the process like to go through to becoming an astronaut?   Christina Koch: It was a neat process.  I actually traveled to Houston for both of my multiday on site interviews at NASA from American Samoa and like Bob knows, only two flights leave American Samoa per week.  So it was no small feat just getting back here, back to the states.  Bob was really supportive.  He got some friends together before my interviews, made me cards, made sure that everybody was rooting for me back home in American Samoa.  And then when the call came, a lot of people tell the story that as soon as they heard the person on the other end of the line they knew whether it was the good call or the bad call because they were kind of in on knowing that.  I actually hadn't -- I wasn't kind of didn't have that insiders information so I had no idea.  And I just assumed it was going to be the rejection call.  So as soon as the person started talking I immediately launched into my speech of \"Thank you for the time.  It's been a great honor.\"  And they actually had to stop me.  It was Janet Kavandi, and she said, \"Wait no, I'm calling to tell you I want you to join our team here in Houston.\"   And I was so baffled that I couldn't speak.  I didn't answer.  I just stopped talking and she said, \"Hello?\"  [laughs], and eventually I regained my composure and finished the conversation with her.  But as you know, they ask you not to tell too many people.  So the other neat thing about the call is because the time difference, it came in at 6:00 in the morning, so it actually woke me up.  And so I was kind of out it during the call and on top of that wasn't allowed to really talk to anyone about it.  I would have told Bob, but actually that week he had a big talk coming up at work and so I thought, well let me not, you know, enter too much of a distraction here.  So by the end of the day, the end of the work day of the day I received the call in the morning, I was almost wondering if it had really happened.  Was that -- you know, was that a dream?  So I remember getting back from work that day and checking the little Post-It note next to my bed and I had scribbled some notes and so I thought, \"OK, that really happened.\"  [laughs].   Host: I can't imagine keeping a secret like that from people.   Christina Koch: Yeah it was a lot to take in all at once.  It took me an hour before I started crying about it.  I was actually on my way to work when it kind of hit me.  And then, you know, I just sort of processes it during the day and it was in some ways kind of nice to have that news to yourself and just kind of think about what it's going to mean for you in your life before you start to share it.   Host: And so Bob, how did you finally find out?   Bob Koch: Well, yeah I remember the night that she finally told me, and you know, a couple, a lot of emotions, you know, came over me.  I was so proud, so excited.  I was also like, wow this is a big secret.  You know, that a big one to keep.  And I was like, \"OK, I guess we're heading to Houston.\"   Host: Had either of you been to Houston before?   Christina Koch: No.  Never saw ourselves here necessarily.  Just, you know, had never had a chance to live in this part of the country.   Host: Probably way more people in the immediate area than it sounds like you're used to.  So I hope you've adjusted --   Christina Koch: A little busier than American Samoa, yeah.   Bob Koch: It's definitely a contrast.  It was getting off a plane in the middle of the night from a remote island and then landing in the middle of Houston is a pretty interesting experience.   Host: The surfing at Galveston is not nearly as good as either.   Bob Koch: Yeah, I definitely explored the YouTube video catalog while I was in American Samoa and had to --   Christina Koch: Come to terms [laughing].   Bob Koch: Yeah, I came to the realization that I was going to have to readjust my expectations for surfing.   Christina Koch: Yeah.   Host: And so what was it like kind of adjusting back?  Because was this kind of your first time back in real civilization for a while and Bob, probably for you too if you were out there for a couple years?  What was it like to kind of get back into the swing of things in a city life?   Christina Koch: Yeah, big adjustment.  I had been working in different places for about three years and when I came back Bob still had a year on his contract in American Samoa.  So by the time he got back he had been working abroad for two years.  When I picked him up from the airport I made sure to wear cowboy boots and big cowboy hat to welcome him back to his new life [laughs].  But, you know, it was not only adjusting back to just a regular culture, you know, in the hustle and bustle of a big city, but interestingly we both ended up making adjustment to a new workplace culture because previously we have both been more in a research oriented academia type of work and both of the jobs that we ended up finding back in the states had more of a military culture and a military aspect to them.  Bob can tell you more, but he works that the Army Corp of Engineers, and me here at NASA with the big part of the cadre being former military.  So we would exchange a lot of notes on, you know, different things we would find about the culture.  You know, even just simple things like how you compose an email and your communication styles.  We would sort of compare notes on that and help each other out.   Host: And I have here you're the stewards of a 120-year-old home.   Christina Koch: That's true.   Host: It is haunted?   Christina Koch: Well --   Bob Koch: Not yet.  We have a couple names -- the Little John residence.   Christina Koch: Yeah.   Bob Koch: And it does have a unique history and you know, it's a lot of work but it's a labor of love and it's been a really exciting thing to be a steward of such a unique property while living in the area.   Christina Koch: Yeah, something that really ties us to Galveston and to the area knowing that we're kind of caretakers of this home.  It's a storm survivor home.  So it survived the Great Storm of 1900, which is one of the biggest natural disasters in the history of this country and so, you know, we enjoy working on that kind of as a collective project.   Host: All right, well what's kind of been the ASCAN life for you now transitioning into the ready to fly astronaut?  So what was the ASCAN training like for you?   Christina Koch: Well, I kind of termed it, you know, like learn five careers in two years training flow.  You know, learning how to fly and kind of the piloting aspect of it.  Learning space walks.  Learning a new language.  Learning the systems of the International Space Station and learning how to control the robotic arm.  All of those things are almost, could be a career in of itself.  So jokingly I used to say that my job was to learn something new and be bad at it for a while.  Because the truth is, you know, we all came -- the people in my class came from different backgrounds.  We had different strengths with different areas that we weren't strong in because of the skill set we brought in.  So you really had to get comfortable with learning something completely new and even if it wasn't something that your experience had brought to you from your past life, being comfortable with taking it on and really embracing it, so you know, just learning all of those new things.  I always I also say that it would have been really amazing to see like an MRI of my own brain as it expanded during this time because it was really a fortunate situation.  You know, most people mid-career, mid 30's, don't have the opportunity to suddenly take a U-turn and start to have to learn a completely new career field.  So to just one prove that that's still possible and that there is still all this room for growth even when you're midcareer, where you know some people might be kind of like settling down into a career path, we were actually asked to step it up.  So that was a really neat experience.  And then since ASCAN it's just been a series of interesting additional trainings, finally giving back, having a round job contributing to the program and then finally being really fortunate and getting a flight assignment.   Host: Was there anything you found kind of the most difficult?  A lot of times I hear it's learning the new language.   Christina Koch: Yes.   Host: Especially if, you know, you'd only ever spoke one before.   Christina Koch: That was definitely a challenge for me.  You know, when people ask me what are some -- what's something you can highlight as almost not a failure, but a real challenge that you could use an example to inspire people that might be, you know, meeting difficulty in something they love doing.  And I did not take -- my Russian training was very difficult for me.  I actually ended up having a couple different Russian instructors.  I think I might have been the special child where they were really working on me, making sure that I had the teaching and learning style that I needed for my thick brain for languages.  But I got through it and now I absolutely love Russian.  I've been training almost completely in Russia since the start of this year and I really feel confident in my Russian language.  I absolutely love speaking Russian.  I seek it out at any opportunity.   Bob Koch: And as I said, when we were traveling through Moscow and I went out to visit in the summer, I was just blown away about how well you were communicating with everybody and I just felt totally comfortable going into a restaurant and you were just communicating with anybody.  And yeah, it's pretty amazing to see how quickly you picked it up.   Christina Koch: I like what you said after you watched me in training where, you know, the people during a Soyuz sim, talking to -- you know guiding us through the training and all the displays and everything, you know --   Bob Koch: Yeah it's one—  Christina Koch: Yeah.  Bob Koch: It’s one thing to order, you know, dinner at a restaurant in Russian, but it's another thing to learn instruction on the Soyuz and Russian and that to not only absorb the information but regurgitate it.   Host: Yeah.   Bob Koch: I remember thinking to myself watching her, I was like, I will never complain about not being able to do something again.  And it just was pretty inspiring to be honest with you.   Host: You haven't picked up Russian On Tape to help her practice yet?  You got time.  Bob, you got time.  All right, well you got assigned the mission, the mission is coming up soon.  It's coming up real soon.  What's it been like -- so you've been over in Russia a lot, you've been here, you've been kind of all over the world.  What's it been like to kind of -- have you gotten to go anywhere new you haven't gone before as part of your training?   Christina Koch: Russia was the new spot.  I hadn't been there before the training.  And then the other spot would be the European Space Agency.  I got to go there but I have been there before so that was really nice to see them again.  And yeah, it's been a incredibly humbling experience learning the Soyuz.  Originally I was training before the flight changes after Nick and Aleksey's launch.  I was training as the copilot of the space craft so that involves just really learning every system in a lot of depth and having a lot of simulation events with your Russian commander.  So very intense training there that I absolutely love.  My engineering brain was just happy as a clam.  But also adjusting to not being home as much, really trusting in Bob.  He had the whole home front kind of on lock and just being able to trust in that so that I could fully focus on what I had to over in Russia was awesome.   Host: So, I mean the mission is coming up really soon.  What are some of the kind of the final things that you guys have to do?  I know there's -- it's almost like going back to school, you have to go through your final exams again.  I mean is that the first time since college you had to be in kind of a testing environment?  With instructors staring you down.   Christina Koch: Well a couple things about that.  One the astronaut candidate process really prepared me for the idea of being evaluated.  I joke all the time that a typical work day for me could include people, you know, eight people following me around with a clipboard as I, you know, perform some kind of a task.  So the evaluation is nothing new at this point.  The different style in Russian is very interesting.  All of our exams in ground school are oral exams.  So getting asked questions in Russian by a committee of ten people is definitely different but a challenge that I got used to and could come to enjoy.  But the final preparations really for us are kind of unique because we are learning to work together as a new crew.  So I joined Nick and Aleksey when they were put into this flight slot and they've both been really welcoming.  I've had a chance to do Soyuz sims with Aleksey, as well as some Russian segment International Space Station sims and then of course Nick and I are astronaut classmates.  So we know each other really, really well.  We've been training forever.  He actually was the first person I ever was in a Soyuz with when we had one of our very first familiarization trainings with the Soyuz, you know, five years ago.  It just so happened to be that I was paired with Nick.  So it's kind of neat to see how far we've come.  But really just learning that crew and kind of making sure everything is buttoned up at home.  Working a lot with Bob on the trip, the launch trip and yeah, ducks in a row.   Host:Have you ever been to Kazakhstan, Bob?   Bob Koch: No, this will be my first time.   Host: This will be your first time.  Have you heard anything about it yet?  Are you looking forward to it?   Bob Koch: Well, I guess being that the launch is at the end of February and March, it's going to be pretty cold out.   Host: Yeah, bring your coat.    Bob Koch: Yeah, we've just been prepping for the weather, you know, coming from Texas and going there is going to be quite a contrast.  But yeah, I just want to take it all in and I'm really just excited for to watch Christina launch and it's just, it's just so exciting.   Host: Have you seen a rocket launch before?   Bob Koch: No, I have not.   Host: So this will be your first one.  First time you see a rocket launch will be when Christina is on it.   Bob Koch: Yeah, and the range of emotions when you see the roll out and I've seen some pictures.  There's a great Instagram follow that Christina put me on that has a lot of great PR over there.  And it just kind of gave me a good idea of what to expect and so yeah, super exciting and I'm really looking forward to it.   Host: Yeah, definitely bring your coat and there will be some astronauts along that will help get you through it and they all speak fantastic Russian just like Christina, so they'll help you out anytime you're in a restaurant.  That's, I mean that's exciting though.  It's always, we get to ask you guys a bunch about how you're preparing and stuff like that, but it can't ever be easy.  We always hear from the astronauts that the thing they miss most is the family and I imagine for the family the thing you miss most is obviously the person who is up in space for six months.   Bob Koch: Absolutely.  I'll be just -- I just can't wait for it to all go down.  I'm just so proud of Christina and my goal is just been to support her as best I can throughout the whole process, you know her flow is definitely been accelerated, and you know, like I said, when she gets home make sure everything is in order and make sure everything is in order and make sure she's taken care of and that's the best I can do to support the mission.   Host: Make sure the house is still there [laughter].  So do you have like a space bucket list or anything like that?  I always like to imagine in my wild imagination that going to space is like talking to your buddies that have been to an amusement park and they're like, \"Go on this rollercoaster!  Go do this!\"  And that translates to \"Go do a space walk\" or \"Fixing this thing is absolutely miserable.\"   Christina Koch: Absolutely [laughing].   Host: Do you have kind of a checklist that you're hoping to go through once you're up there?   Christina Koch: Well, you know, we do talk a lot amongst our cadre about, you know, the plusses and minuses, the good and the bad, the things that you definitely want to make sure you do in terms of what you bring up there or to make yourself comfortable and to be efficient in your work there.  So a lot of advice I've received over the years.  And I think I've always had photography as a hobby of mine and time-lapse photography and movies, so I'm really looking forward to the photography.  I like doing lifestyle photography as well, so I'm hoping to do some kind of, you know, life on board the space station photography to really tell the story of what it's like running these experiments and keeping the, you know, the orbiting laboratory running.  And other than that, my mission, you know no real bucket list for myself.  I just want to, you know, give back.  I've been in a lot of training and I'm just ready to kind of put it to use and to hopefully be really productive and get a lot out of the mission for science and for keeping the station running smoothly.   Host: There's got to be a -- like, do you want any -- like, are you dying to go to a spacewalk? You’re a rock climber so spacewalk is is kind of like rock climbing in a sense because you have tethers.   Christina Koch: A space walk, absolutely.  Yeah, spacewalk really speaks to a lot of the things that I find that I love and I find challenging, you know, mental and physical fortitude, the equipment, the technical aspects of it and you know, if I were fortunate enough to be able to do a spacewalk and there are some planned for my mission, I mean that would just be the real culmination of just everything I worked on both in my life before arriving here and all the training that I've received since I got here, the treat training teams that have prepared me.  So that would definitely be a highlight.   Host: So at the time of this recording we're about two months away from your launch.  Is there any kind of last minute stuff you're having to check off?  Anything you're having to do before you go?  Any last training?  Because again, yeah you said you go to Russia real soon so it's got to all kind of feel like the freight train is running now.   Christina Koch: It sure is.  From my aspect training wise, kind of buttoning up all of my final emergency qualification simulation events and just making sure I'm ready to support Nick and Aleksey when we do our qualification exams in Russia and making sure that, you know, the ducks are in line for the accelerated launch date.  The launch date had been April 6th and right now it's scheduled for February 28th.  So a little bit sooner than we had prepped for, but my family is ready and I'm ready so just, you know, making sure that things are buttoned up.   Host: You ready, Bob?   Bob Koch: Oh I'm ready.   Host: You're ready.  All right, well Christina Koch, NASA Astronaut.  Bob Koch, Army Corps of Engineers and Christina's husband.  Thank you guys for joining me.  Christina, we're super excited to see you fly along with Nick and Aleksey and we'll be following along.  And yeah, take a million pictures because we never say no to more pictures.   Christina Koch: Sounds great.  Thank you so much for having me.  It's been my pleasure.   Bob Koch: Thanks for having us.   [ Music ]   Host: You're definitely going to want to watch Christina launch into outer space and you can see that live on NASA TV.  So be sure to head over to NASA.gov/ntv to watch her launch along with NASA's Nick Hague and Roscosmos Cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin.  Check out Episode 65 to listen to Nick Hague's story that he gave us right before his first launch in October, which as aborted during ascent.  Now he and Ovchinin are getting a second shot, this time along with Christina Koch.  And as always you could find all of the latest updates on the International Space Station online at NASA.gov/ISS or on all of our different social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  This episode was recorded on December 20th, 2018 thanks to Alex Perryman, John Stoll, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, John Streeter, Brandi Dean, and Gary Jordan.  And thanks again to Christina Koch for coming on the show.  God speed and good luck on the launch and we'll be back next week.",

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 184, \"Expedition 1: The Beginning.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. Today, we take you back in time, a generation, to when the permanent human presence on the International Space Station began. The first module of the International Space Station, the Zarya control module, was launched from Kazakhstan on November 20th, 1998, followed by five flights of NASA's space shuttles, which delivered more components and equipment for the inside of the station. But those shuttle crews stayed aboard only a short time. It wasn't until October 31st of 2000 that the first permanent crew, Expedition 1, lifted off in their Soyuz spacecraft. On November 2nd, it docked to the station's Zvezda module, and station commander Bill Shepherd of NASA, Soyuz commander Yuri Gidzenko, and flight engineer Sergei Krikalev floated inside to begin a global adventure in space. We're going to let you get a peek inside that mission, how it came to be, and how it established a pattern of operations that has sustained this international endeavor for more than 20 years now, right into Expedition 64 aboard the station today. Recently, NASA kicked off a series of panel discussions in recognition of the 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the station. Like many other gatherings in the age of COVID-19, this one was a virtual gathering of six participants on the internet, so you'll understand why, on a few occasions, their sound levels dip a bit. But the story's terrific, and we want to share. The moderator is Space Foundation board member and veteran journalist Jeanne Meserve, and she will introduce you to former Johnson Space Center Director George Abbey, Expedition 1 Training Integrator, Ginger Kerrick, and the Expedition 1 crew members themselves, Bill Shepherd, Yuri Gidzenko, and Sergei Krikalev. Here we go.  [ Music]  Jeanne Meserve: Hello, I'm Jeanne Meserve, and we are marking an important anniversary. Twenty years ago, three men embarked on a journey, a journey to the International Space Station, where they became the first full-time inhabitants. We are now marking two decades of habitation, cooperation, and investigation. Today, we're going to be talking about what's been done up there, what it has meant, and we're going to do that by talking to the crew of Expedition 1, and some of those who supported them. This conversation is brought to you by the team at NASA, and by the Space Foundation. We had hoped to do this conversation in person at the Space Symposium, but COVID. So, let me introduce to you our guests today, joining us virtually. First, the members of the crew -- we have the commander who is with us, Bill Shepherd. He joins us from Virginia. Also, with us from Russia, his crewmates, Sergei Krikalev and also Yuri Gidzenko. Also joining us from Texas, a man whose vision, and management, and oversight was crucial to the success of the mission, George Abbey. He was -- he is the former director of the Johnson Space Center, and also joining us is Ginger Kerrick of NASA, who was the Russian training integration instructor for Expedition 1. Great to have you all with us here today. George Abbey, I'd love to start with you, and get a sense of what you hoped for from this mission. What was your goal? What did NASA think it would get out of this?  George Abbey: Well, I thought it was very important that we partner with our Russian colleagues. We were working on a space station and had been working on it for some period of time and were not too successful. So, we went through a redesign, and I felt it was important to bring our Russian colleagues in on it, make them a part of the program. And actually, the program started with the Shuttle-Mir, which was the Russian space station, and that gave us an opportunity to get some experience on space stations, as we were planning a space station. And we were able to work with the Russians and do that on the Mir program, at the same time, partnering with them on an International Space Station, and was -- turned out to be an excellent partnership. And I think our success was really, in large part due to the fact that we had that partnership. And so, as we worked into the Shuttle-Mir program, we were looking ahead to the International Space Station, and finally being able to get that first element up, and then, of course, get the crew up, which came about a year and a half after that first element went up. So, I was looking forward to that day, and with great expectations, and great hope that we would finally get the program underway, and get that first crew up there, which we did. And we have -- we're fortunate to have all three crew members with us this morning.  Jeanne Meserve: And I wanted to ask you about these three crew members. Why were these three picked for Expedition 1?  George Abbey: Well, I think they were picked based on their experience and their backgrounds. We wanted to make sure that first crew was an experienced crew, and it was going to be a first -- the first time in space with the space station. And we wanted someone who had been up there before, and also could work in that environment, and if there were problems, could deal with them. And we selected a crew where we had high confidence with the three crewmen that they would be able to do that, and that turned out to be certainly the case. And we were fortunate to have all three of them up there as we went through that first step on Expedition 1.  Jeanne Meserve: Ginger, you ended up working with these guys for years, getting them ready for this mission. Would you agree this was the right combination of personalities and skills?  Ginger Kerrick: Oh, absolutely. From day one -- you know, you got to remember, this is the first time we were training a crew for the space station. So, we were building it as we went along, and all three of the crew members were quick to identify gaps in the support plan that we had put forward, not only for training, but for operations. So, they were the perfect people. It took the courage for them to step out and try to establish a new training paradigm, a new operations paradigm, and they proved to be successful once they executed their mission.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei, I'd like to ask you and Shep both -- you were both -- come out of a military background, where you were trained to view one another as adversaries. Here, you're put in this situation where you're going to interact cooperatively. Was that a difficult transition, or did that come naturally to both of you?  Bill Shepherd: Sergei, why don't you go ahead?  Sergei Krikalev: OK. So, at first, I came not from military background. So that's one point, and second -- maybe most important, that this was not the first experience. My first spaceflight was international mission together with French cosmonaut, but also before that, before this mission, I was trained and flew twice on shuttle. First flight was on STS-60, and we were trained together. Charlie Bolden was the commander of this mission, and my second flight on shuttle was actually first assembly mission, so -- first station assembly mission, STS-88 with Bob Cabana as a commander. So, it was not the first experience, and actually even before us, many years ago, was very good example of good relations and good partnership from [inaudible], so we were based on previous experience, and ready for good cooperation. And that's why I think everything went very smooth from my point of view.  Jeanne Meserve: Now, Shep, you did have a military background. I'm right there, aren't I?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah. Actually, Yuri and I were really the two military guys. Jumping way ahead in the answer, one of my most interesting moments with Yuri in space was looking at the Earth, and he was saying, \"OK, I was a MiG-21 pilot, and I was stationed here.\" And half an orbit later, I would say, \"OK, I was a Navy SEAL, and we were here, here, and here.\" And that was a really interesting dialogue, but I think my personal interest in being part of this crew was to try and put the space station on the footing of either the early space voyages, where we did not have a lot of contact with the ground, and that seems to be -- seemed to me to be much more like being on a ship or a submarine than flying an airplane. So, NASA had a shuttle program, which was basically airplane flying, and I thought we were doing something different with space station, and that's why I really wanted to be in the first crew. I went to Russia. I had certain views on how the partners should interact, and fortunately, Yuri and Sergei helped me maybe change my views quite a bit on what I thought was the right way to do things. And so, I was really fortunate to have both those guys on the crew, because they taught me a lot. Jeanne, if I might suggest, why don't you ask Ginger if she can explain what brain-sharing was.  Jeanne Meserve: Brain-sharing? Ginger, you want to hop in here?  Ginger Kerrick: Oh, sure. So, one of the things that Yuri was talking about was that it was difficult to train when you didn't have training materials. You didn't have all the right simulations. So, we spent a lot of time with the hardware owners, the hardware developers, and there was one particular instance where this brain-sharing name came to be, is Shep had gone and met with some -- one of the hardware developers, and was asking a series of questions, you know, three or four questions. And then, Sergei was a little late, so Sergei comes in, and he looks at the hardware, and immediately, same three or four questions. And we were just like, oh my God, they're sharing a brain now. These two --  Jeanne Meserve: Oh, I'm curious about the language issue. What was the language that you spoke?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, I thought initially that because the United States had an agreement with the other partners, where we said English was going to be the standard language, that would be the way to go, but I got to Russia and was working with many of the engineers, technicians, and managers. Some of these people helped to put Sputnik in space, and launched Yuri Gagarin, and these people were still there. And so, I thought -- I said, \"Well, we're not going to completely invert the Russian space system because we like English.\" But even beyond that, in order for -- it's not enough to know what the Russians did. The key element of making a space station work was to understand why the Russians approached problems a certain way, and the only method by which we were really going to get to that was if we could talk to all these people in Russian. So, that became the way we operated. If we could pull up picture number four, I'll show you kind of one of the crutches that we used to get by that, if we can do some screen sharing here. Yeah, what this is -- it's going to be a picture of me in one of the training mockups, and a big sheet of paper to the right is a big schematic drawing of the air purification system that I'm working on. And our effort -- the early-on in the space station training was to create very understandable graphic diagrams of all the systems that we had to use, and I -- Ginger, correct me if I'm wrong. I think we still use these today.  Ginger Kerrick: Yes, we still use those today.  Bill Shepherd: And for me, that was a big help, because a lot of times, I could go through class, and I could look at the diagram, and even if I didn't get 100% what the instructor was trying to teach us, I could make sense out of it by referring to the diagram.  Jeanne Meserve: So, Ginger or Shep, I'm curious as to whether the Russians had a very different approach to training, if there were things that you learned from participating in Russia that might not have been obvious to you previously.  Ginger Kerrick: Yeah. You know, they broke down lessons into theoretical and practical, and you would get all of your theoretical lessons, and then do your practical lessons. They had a less of a reliance on diagrams and documentation, because they had -- the people teaching the classes were experts, and knew that information inside and out, whereas on the U.S. side, we were all starting up. A lot of the instructors were young. I was young at that time, and so, we were developing materials. And we didn't have the expertise. So, it was interesting to see the dichotomy between the U.S. approach and the Russian approach, but we learned a lot from each other, and I think each of us adapted our approaches so that we were both better off in the end.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei -- hear your perspective from the Russian side. Did the Americans have something to teach you?  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, Ginger is 100% correct. We were learning from each other, and returning back to your previous question, what was the language. Shep was speaking some Russian. We were speaking some English, so we called this mixture of languages Runglish, and that's what we used during the mission. We actually, had this name when I was training for shuttle, shuttle flight, and actually for us, it was very interesting exchange of experience. Because we were -- Ginger is right. We were based more on theoretical knowledge of the system, and preparation for long-duration flight was such that we -- we were not able to repeat every step for several times, getting ready for the flight. Because flight itself is long, and you cannot do kind of usual rehearsal. But it was certainly possible to do, and training for short-duration flight is little different. But what we learned -- that we can use more computer-generated lessons, or mock-up, simulators. Before that, computer was not as available, and we had to have all these diagram in our head. We had to understand how system worked, and it actually had some advantages. Because if you are working in stressful environment and limited amount of time, sometimes better to have everything in your head, although it's more difficult to build up this knowledge. But as we said, we were learning from each other. We tried to share our experience, experience of Mir missions, and we were learning from all this computer-supported training from U.S. side. And I think at the end, now we have some kind of mixed system of training crew for now. Actually, it may be more difficult as we have in the beginning. No one exactly knew what kind of knowledge we will need in flight. So, for this purpose, in case of this uncertainty, we had to have more information that we really needed, because no one knew how much information exactly we need. And I see now the training for subsequent missions, and especially now, allow people to learn only what they really need for the flight. In our case, we learn with some margin, and it was really interesting.  Jeanne Meserve: Yuri, did you want to weigh in on what you might've learned from the American side?  Yuri Gidzenko: Agree with Sergei. [speaks in Russian]  Sergei Krikalev: [speaks in Russian]  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: It was actually interesting to work together, because we were learning from each other, and different approaches helped us to understand the stations best.  Jeanne Meserve: George, was this exactly the kind of synergy you wanted to see come out of this international mission?  George Abbey: Yes, it was. It really turned out just to be what I had hoped it to be, and we had worked with our Russian colleagues before on Apollo-Soyuz, the first joint docking mission. And so, I had confidence that we would be able to work with them, and it would really turn out to be a good partnership for us, and that we could learn from them, and hopefully they could learn from us. And between our two nations, we would come up with a great space station, and I think this crew made it all happen.  Bill Shepherd: Hey, Jeanne, one important point that Sergei touched on that I want to double-down on -- in Houston, we had extensive simulators for the shuttle, and the crew spent hundreds of hours in these machines. And quite often, we would be sitting, waiting for the computers to come up because the sim had crashed, and it happened, like, twice a day. And it took about 30 or 40 minutes to reboot the computers and get everything running again. When I got to Star City, and I asked the instructors there about their Soyuz simulator, and how often they had to reboot it because it had crashed, the answer was, \"Well, we do this maybe once a year.\" And so, when I finished the space station, and I came back to Johnson, I was trying to get the point across to senior management that the way the Russians designed some things is really good, and we need to learn from this. Unfortunately, you know, space technology being what it is, we have a fascination, particularly in the States, with the most complex things we can build. I'm not sure that's the right answer.  Jeanne Meserve: George Abbey, I have to give you a chance to respond to that.  George Abbey: Oh, I think I would go on -- what Shep says. I think the Russian design approach is a very good one, and it -- they come up with very reliable equipment, with very reliable systems. And I think we learned from them, and hopefully, we can adapt some of those lessons, and incorporate them into our spacecraft. But, yes, I agree with Shep.  Jeanne Meserve: Ginger, I'd like to talk to you a little bit about your feelings after working with these guys for years. They're about to take off. Tell me that story of what that was like, and what you felt, seeing them launch.  Ginger Kerrick: Yeah, you know, I spent four years of my life -- wherever this crew was, that's where I was. If we were in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, looking at the service module before it launched, I was right there with them. If we were in Florida, if we were in Huntsville, Alabama, or Houston, or Star City, Russia -- so we formed quite the bond, and so, on launch day, I got to go to their launch. And it was a foggy day, and I remembered watching them walk up the stairs of the launch vehicle, and as soon as that hatch shut, I started hyperventilating. And I know the spacecraft. I knew that they were going to be safe, but something inside me said, \"My family is going on a rocket,\" and I could not handle it. And one of the Russian high-ranking military officials noticed that, put his arm around me, and started parting the crowd to try to bring me to a closer view. And as he's doing that, he says, [speaks in Russian], \"It's the mother of the crew. Get out of the way.\" And so, he put me in a spot where I could watch them, and I was reassured that everything was going to be OK. But it was weird, because, you know, we were a family of four, and three of them were going to space.  Jeanne Meserve: And so, the three of you arrive at the space station. Love to get your first impressions. Sergei, what did you feel? What did you see? What did you smell as you arrived there?  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, the service module of International Space Station is very similar to core module of Mir station, mechanically. So, the only difference I felt that -- we came to the station, and it was very new, very clean, and not completely empty, but much emptier that you -- this space -- happened to be after several months of crew living there. So, I remember we were discussing with designers on the ground that maybe the table we had in the middle of this big compartment can be not assembled as a full part, maybe only part of it can exist. But when we came, there was no table. We switch on lights, and the first thing we need to do is prepare our TV down link to have teleconference from the station. And we start to search for connectors, and it was typical operation, but it was very memorable. Switching on light for the first time when we came to almost dark station, switching on light, and it became very light.   Yuri Gidzenko: Hot water.  Sergei Krivalev: And trying to make hot water, because for two days, we were flying on Soyuz. We had only snacks and cold food, so we knew how system was built, and start to activate hot water to have hot drink on the station, right? Yuri is right.  Jeanne Meserve: Yuri, the job of your crew primarily was to set up house on the space station. Can you talk to us a little bit about that, what you had to do when you got there, besides getting hot water for something to drink.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: Well, first, I want to say that when we just got there, we were not able to open the hatch right away. We had struggle, with Sergei, with our legs, with our arms, for maybe five minutes, and we were thinking, how come? We just arrived to the station, but we are not able to get in.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: And we finally opened the hatch, and we got in. As Sergei said, we turned on the light. We got some hot water. We activated the toilet, and I remember Shep said, \"Now, we can live. We have light. We have hot water, and we have a toilet.\"  Bill Shepherd: Jeanne, jumping in again, I think history may forget our first cargo ship came up about ten days after we arrived, and Yuri did a great job of docking it, because it was supposed to find us automatically. But it came up, and it was acting very strangely, and Yuri flew it in by hand. Maybe he can tell a little bit -- Yuri and Sergei can tell a little bit about how that went. It was a pretty big deal.  Sergei Krikalev: Yeah, it was unusual docking, because the ship said -- this cargo vehicle is supposed to approach and then dock in automatic mode. But when it came for about 100 meters range, then it start to wobble, and searching for docking. And this oscillation became so big that it start to be dangerous, and fortunately, we had opportunity to manual control it. So, we had to switch to manual control, and Yuri was controlling it by hand controllers installed in the station. But next issue was that lens on the camera that was used for landing vehicle was fogged, and we didn't know what is this fog. Is it kind of glue or something else stick to the window of this camera, or something else? So, we called this remote control of the vehicle mode is tele-operation mode, but the problem was that, because Yuri cannot see station and target well, I was jumping to window. And we have what we said tele-tele-operation mode, because I was looking out in the window, give some guidance to Yuri, and Yuri was trying to control it, try to use some image on the monitor, and some information that he got from me, because I was looking directly at the approaching vehicle. So finally, we were able to station this vehicle very close to the station, and on sunlight, this fog on the lens came out, and we were able finally to dock. That was very unusual way of docking vehicle, but fortunately, we had very, many layers of redundancy. And one of these layers worked out well, and we were able to do docking safely. And maybe, Shep can add something, because he was monitoring and recording this uh, looking at us jumping to the control panel, to window and back.  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, I think it's one of the issues of, if you will, the culture. Russian designs put in many ways to get things done. There's lots of redundancy, and in some programs, the U.S. does not have as much. And I think that's one of the things, in the future, we need to pay a lot of attention to.  Jeanne Meserve: Shep, can you tell us what the average day would've been like? This was obviously an unusual day, when you had this docking drama, but what about the average day? What did you guys do? Did you have assigned responsibilities? Did you all do a little bit of everything? How did it go?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I've got to say that I don't think you could say we had an average day, at least not too many of them. But this was good, because we were up there to get a lot of work done, and every day seemed to have its own set of challenges. We got up 6:30-ish in the morning. I like to get a cup of coffee, and read on the laptop or the printouts, kind of what the ground wanted us to do. But from then on, it was kind of free-for-all. The one thing I did enjoy was we got together around the galley table -- another story about that, but three times a day, we made a point to have our meals together. And that was a big part of keeping everybody kind of on the same plan of the day, but I'll let Yuri and Sergei talk about their perspectives.  Jeanne Meserve: Yuri, tell us what you thought. Really having trouble hearing you.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: Well, my impression, after looking back, you know, 20 years back, seems like the first couple of weeks, we were just working, and working, and working.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: Especially the first week, I think -- I thought shaving, we did -- we shaved probably, like, three days after we arrived, maybe even later, because we were not able to find the equipment --  Sergei Krivalev: The razor.  Interpreter: -- the razor.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: But it was extremely interesting, very interesting.  Jeanne Meserve: George, I'm curious if there ever was tension between what the United States wanted the crew to be doing, and what the Russians wanted the crew to be doing.  George Abbey: No, actually, there wasn't any of that kind of tension. I think that -- I mean, I worked with the Russians on the Mir program, the Shuttle-Mir program. We had developed a lot of confidence in each other, and confidence when they made a decision that they exercised all of everything that needed to be done to make sure it was a good decision. And so, really, those missions that we flew to the Mir and working with the Russians in their control center really gave us a good foundation for moving into the assembly flights and -- flight with the International Space Station. So, initially on the Shuttle-Mir, we had some tensions, but that had been well worked out by the time we were doing the first mission to the International Space Station.  Bill Shepherd: Hey, Jeanne, I got to jump in on that, because early on, the two control centers flying the ISS was kind of new for both of them, and about for the first maybe two or three weeks of things, occasionally, we would get conflicting marching orders, things that Houston had said, and then the control center in Moscow changed later. And this -- and it would go back and forth almost orbit by orbit sometimes, and I got really frustrated one day. And I got on the radio, and both control centers can hear you when you can talk to the ground station, and said, \"Look, we're the International Space Station. You guys have to coordinate one plan and give it to us, and that's the one we'll do. We're not doing one plan for Moscow and one plan for Houston.\" They just needed that little reminder, and I was happy to give it to them. And I got to say, that was my happiest day in space [laughter].  Jeanne Meserve: So, you guys were living together in pretty tight quarters up there. How did you get along? I mean, were there tensions that developed? Were you ever able to have privacy? Was everybody chummy? Who wants to weigh in first?  Sergei Krikalev: Station was not big at that time, but I think it was still bigger than shuttle, shuttle cockpit, and we had enough room to have at least some privacy. But really, we don't need much privacy, because we were working together. And I would like to return back maybe to previous question. Shep said that we didn't have normal day, because every day was special. And I also remember another interesting thing. When we were still on the ground preparing for the flight, and we were shown tools we are going to have onboard on the station. One of the big tools -- I don't know how it called in English, but like big chunk of metal, like you open the door or safe, but Shep was looking, saying, \"Why do we need this big, heavy instrument in there?\" We said, \"Well, Shep, let's take it just in case.\" And I think maybe not in first, but in the second week, when we were installing one of the equipment that supposed to take, like, 15 minutes to install, and when we had the training for this installation on the ground, it was very simple. We would just put it in, make several connection, and put four bolts to hold this piece of equipment. On the station, maybe station was deformed little bit from ground position and flight position, but really, we need to use all heavy tools to make this piece of equipment fit in the proper place. And it was almost like -- I don't know, special adventure. So, every day was very adventurous.  Jeanne Meserve: Ginger, we talked a little bit about how you felt seeing these guys go off, that you were the mother of the crew. Are you still close with these guys?  Ginger Kerrick: Oh, very much so. Every time I'm in town -- well, in Russia, I always try to find Yuri and Sergei. I think I saw Yuri a couple of Novembers ago, when I was in Star City, and Sergei makes more frequent trips out to the U.S. So, he was able to meet my fiancée his last trip, and I'm hoping that they can both make it for the wedding in March, if travel allows. And Shep is going to be giving me away, so yes, we still stay in touch. We have formed, I think, what are lifelong friendships, and I'm very thankful to NASA for giving me a job that allowed me not only to support the Expedition 1 crew and their mission, but also to make such great friends.  Jeanne Meserve: We're coming down to our last minutes, and I'd like to get from each of you your thoughts on what the big takeaway from your mission was. Shep, why don't we start with you?  Bill Shepherd: I think space station, particularly Expedition 1, set the tone for how crews need to operate in space -- that we can fly a really big, complex vehicle, lots of international partners, and with the right ground support and training, we can figure out how to make it all work. I think it's the blueprint for larger expeditions, and going certainly to the Moon, and probably beyond that to Mars and elsewhere.  Jeanne Meserve: Yuri, big takeaway from the mission?  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: Yes, I just will join Shep here, and want to add that the main objective for our mission was to prepare the station for the next crew, so for crew number two, crew number three, and so forth.  Yuri Gidzenko: [speaks in Russian]  Interpreter: And I just wanted to add that, right now, on the station, we have already crew number 63. This is mission number 63, and 64 there as well, and 63 is going to land today.  Yuri Gidzenko: Sixty-four missions.  Jeanne Meserve: Sergei, your thoughts on reflecting on your mission?  Sergei Krikalev: Well, as we said at that time, that goal of our mission was to make station alive, because when we came, most of the system was shut down. Some of them was not even installed, and some of them, installation and activation of the system was life critical. So, if we wouldn't be able to do this on time, we'd have to stop mission early and return back home. So, we -- as a crew, we need to be very reliable, and I think our crew was able to do what we're supposed to do. But I think our goal was not only prepare station for future experiments. I think space station program itself is very big and interesting technical experiment. What we did on Expedition 1 was big technical experiment, because we were put some things together, and we were activating them in unusual situation. As we said, some of the hardware never met each other on the ground, and we had to install it in space for the first time. And not every time it was smooth. So, I think it was very interesting technical and organizational experiment, and the result of this experiment, we are using up to now, and as Yuri said, 63 and -- Expeditions 63 and 64 is flying now. So, result of our first technical and organizational experiment was successful.  Jeanne Meserve: Ginger?  Ginger Kerrick: I'd like to build on what Sergei and Yuri said, with respect to the marvel of construction that is the International Space Station. I think they were able to set the tone, the Expedition 1 crew and the International Space Station program, that the world should follow. You know, when you look in the news today, and you see our countries not getting along, or other countries not getting along, and yet, when you work on a common goal, even if something as complicated as the International Space Station, we have proven to the world that when you're joined in a common goal, that you can accomplish anything. So, I think the ISS should be the model for how the world should be getting along, how the world should be making bigger and better things together.  Jeanne Meserve: George Abbey, let me give the last word to you on what this mission accomplished, and what it's meant.  George Abbey: I was convinced that -- before this mission that if we're going to explore space, we need to do that working internationally, that it's much better to work with partners, and I think this first crew proved that. As Sergei was saying, we had the components and systems that were built all over the world, and they came together for the first time in space. And this crew was able to deal with them, and put them together, and make them all work. And that provided a good foundation to build on the 20 years that have followed on the space station, and as Ginger said, this is a model -- should be a model for what we should do in the future. Because as we -- when beyond Earth orbit, going back to the Moon, and maybe someday to Mars, we ought to be doing it internationally, and do it in the same way that we're working together on the International Space Station. It is truly a model for how one can work with other countries, and not only with Russia, but all the partnerships that we form with the International Space Station.  Jeanne Meserve: And with that, I want to thank you all for your participation today and thank you all for your contributions to science and cooperation internationally. And on behalf of NASA and the Space Foundation, thanks to all of you who are watching us today. There will be more ISS 20th-anniversary programming on NASA television, and also on the Space Foundation's new online digital platform, Space Symposium 365. You can learn more about that by going to www.spacesymposium365.org. I'm Jeanne Meserve. Please, all of you, stay well.  [ Music]  Host: Terrific talk there to learn some inside stuff about how NASA and its international partners worked through some troubles to get the International Space Station on orbit, and then to put the first crew members aboard to continue assembly of the station, and work out the issues that were bound to come up when the whole world tries to work together on a project of this scale. I especially liked hearing the crew members talk about some of the things that happened during their time in space that the rest of us didn't all know about at the time. Well, there's more to come. This celebration of the space station's 20th anniversary continues, five more of these great discussions to come. Next up will be the people who actually fly the station from right here on the ground, insight into the people who run things in Mission Control Houston.

            "description": "Gary Jordan: Houston, we have a birthday. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 99. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be kicking off this discussion today. Two years ago, this week, we launched the very first Episode of Houston, We Have a Podcast and what a ride it has been. We've brought in so many scientists, engineers, astronauts to talk about a huge variety of topics, and to share some of their incredible stories. So, to celebrate another great year of Houston, We Have a Podcast, the podcast team is going in front of the mics once again to talk about our favorite moments from this past year of Episodes. Today, I'm sitting down with producer an audio engineer Alex Perryman, as well as producer and host, Pat Ryan, and host, Dan Huot. So, if you're new to the show, this should give you some great perspective on some of the conversations we've had so far. Happy birthday to us! Let's jump right ahead to reminiscing with the podcast team. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Gary Jordan: One more year down, guys. We are two years into the podcast. How's everyone feeling? Alex, how you feeling two years in?  Alex Perryman: Feeling good.  Gary Jordan: You were one of the original people that actually helped to start this off. Does it feel like two years?  Alex Perryman: Yeah, it feels great, you know, it feels nice to be the -- the OG in the group.   [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: That’s true -- well, you -- you definitely -- it was me and you definitely from the beginning. Dan, you actually were part of Episode 1, which was more like the introduction to let's see if we can do this.  Dan Huot: Yeah, let's -- let's see how bad and we are make sure we can actually do this and then try to fix it.  Gary Jordan: That's why the first four minutes of that Episode do not exist.  Dan Huot: They never, ever saw the light of the day.  Gary Jordan: Well, that's what it was, it was us trying to figure this out. And then we got where -- I feel like this is like a regular thing now, we're doing it -- we're doing it weekly and now we have --Alex, you're part of the regular team. Pat, now you're part of the regular team and have been for over a year now?  Pat Ryan: Probably -- yeah, a little over a year.  Gary Jordan: Okay, and we have Norah who's behind us snapping pictures.  Pat Ryan: Hi, Norah.  Norah Moran: Hi.  Dan Huot: She's pointing bright lights in our eyes.  Gary Jordan: All right, so today, I'm going to do -- remember how what we did last year, basically, just sat down and sort of reminisced, pulled out our favorite clips. I've pulled out some of my favorite moments and I hope you guys have done the same, and just want to go from when I guess the day the -- the week -- sorry -- after the last birthday Episode. So, starting with that week, Episode 53 was Stan Love.  [Transition Music]  Stan Love: And by the way, the toilet is part of your water and oxygen supply, just --  Gary Jordan: Ah, so if the toilet breaks, that also means that you're going to be able to --  Stan Love: Yeah. Yeah, what a way to die, right? I was going to be the brave first explorer on Mars and I died because the toilet broke, that's not going to look good.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: And actually, I looked online, this Episode -- sorry, Dan, beat the Episode 1 with you.   Alex Perryman: Yep.  Gary Jordan: This one now has the most downloads of any Episode that we've ever done.  Pat Ryan: Well, it is Stan Love.  Dan Huot: Now my life is meaningless.  Pat Ryan: Now?  [Laughter]  Dan Huot: Thank you, Pat.  Gary Jordan: A lot of love in this room.  Pat Ryan: Now you’re paying attention.   Gary Jordan: But interestingly enough that one was actually -- almost didn't happen because Stan Love, we were supposed to record for two purposes, one was to try to see how much time we had and maybe we can get another Episode out of him. But really, Stan Love was supposed to record extra audio clips for the hazard series we were doing with human research program because we got together all these different people that they laid out, that they wanted to talk through these five hazards, and Stan Love and Mike Barratt were going to add to that from the astronaut perspective. I forget exactly what happened. Alex, help me remember. I think like we were supposed to record in this room where we are Studio A.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: But I think everything -- everything was doubled booked.  Alex Perryman: Everything that could go wrong went wrong that day.  Gary Jordan: Yes.  Alex Perryman: It was to the point where I think I was double booked as being the audio engineer.  Gary Jordan: What were you supposed -- what were -- what were you doing instead?  Alex Perryman: There was a -- I think there was like an in-flight event going on, so there was like a live event going on, and in some kind of way, this room got double booked and we were the smallest thing on the chain, so we got kicked out of this room. And then we ended up having to go into a closet that's next to a bathroom.  Gary Jordan: Well, we have -- we have -- we have this studio, right? We have Studio B, we have another studio, and we have a sound booth, and all three of those were taking up.  Alex Perryman: Yes. Were taken.  Gary Jordan: So we ended up going literally into a closet next to the bathrooms. Actually, if you listen to that Episode, you can hear a little bit of foot traffic in the background of people going back and forth because we had to get jammed to do that -- but what was interesting is Stan Love absolutely loved recording that Episode.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: He's -- he had another conflict that he was backed up right against to record this Episode and he goes, don't worry about it. He goes, I can -- I can spend another 30 minutes. We recorded an extra 30 minutes, got everything, got this solo episode and all the clips used for hazard series and at the end, he's like, if you ever want me to do this again, like let -- just let me know and I'll -- and I'll come out and come on and do that again, so we have to have Stan Love back.  Dan Huot: And that -- it doesn't surprise me that he's one of the top episodes because he's such a good storyteller.  Gary Jordan: He is.  Dan Huot: He’s been giving the talks about why going to Mars is so hard and things like that for years and it's captivating.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Dan Huot: Because he takes something that's just obviously one of the hardest things humanity could ever do and he boils it down into oh, I can actually understand how why this is so freaking hard to pull off.  Gary Jordan: And actually, if you go online, the reason that -- while I had him for this hazard series that I wanted to focus on this specifically is because he's done a lecture. Just like you said, he's been doing the same lecture, but there's like a 40 minute online thing you can find on YouTube somewhere, where he goes through why Mars is hard. And what I did was I organized a sort of topic based script. And wanted to hit as much as I could to replicate what was in that -- that talk but I couldn't hit everything because I had such a short amount of time with him, so we'll definitely have to have him on. But that's where we kicked off the hazard series, that was -- that was part of it. Working with Mel Whiting and the human research program. Mike Barratt was the same way too.   Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: I recorded him in the studio. We did his -- same thing, I wanted to do an episode solo with him, and I wanted to do some clips for the hazard series, but we ran out of time. And he goes, you know what? Just schedule more time with me, I'll be happy to come back, and we -- and we'll redo this. And I sent him the new script and he -- and he literally did more research on each of the hazards to make it as good as possible.   Pat Ryan: Gee.  Gary Jordan: So, that -- so that episode, the one with Mike Barratt is -- the first half, where we were talking about his story, was the first time we recorded. And the second half, which is just the five hazards, was the second time we recorded, where he researched all of the different things, and they're back to back, and I think that was one of the longer episodes we have, like an hour thirty. But those also did pretty well in terms of downloads, all of the different hazards, Zarana Patel, Tom Williams, Erik Antonsen, when we recorded with those guys, Peter Norsk, Brian Crucian, those actually performed a lot better than some of our other stuff.   [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: Yeah, and -- and if -- and if I'm going to the dentist and they're going around the corner when I'm getting blasted with x-rays, I'm sure no one is really going to sign up for -- to get blasted with, you know, radiation as to find out what happens in your body.  Zarana Patel: Yeah, no one -- unfortunately, we cannot irradiate people.  Gary Jordan: You say that from a scientific perspective.  Zarana Patel: Yes. Yes, of course. So, we rely heavily on animal and cellular models to gather the evidence we need to characterize the risk from space radiation and to do -- evaluate countermeasures.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: And that's why I think why we continued with more and more series after that one.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: Because this was sort of a pilot. This is when we did like the going back in time for the International Space Station Begins for the 20th anniversary of the first element launches and stuff like that. Going through, I'm just kind of hitting these different highlights right now. But Episode 63, that was an interesting day because Pat, you were trying to dedicate that day to recording John Hanson for the Heroes series. But we got -- again -- kicked out of everywhere. But this time, it was –  Pat Ryan: Starting with this room.  Gary Jordan: Starting with this room that we're in right now but it was not something that we could undo because the Vice President, Mike Pence, was coming here.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: And Jim Bridenstine, the administrator had a whole day planned. So, Pat, what did you have to do to accommodate John Hansen?  Pat Ryan: Well, the week before, my interview that we had scheduled with Hansen -- and he had agreed to fly in from Dallas to come down and do the whole thing. And the week before, we found out that the Vice President was coming, it was a big surprise, I mean, you know, secret at the time, but we couldn't be in here. This Studio A is only a couple hundred feet from the auditorium where the Vice President was going to be, so the Secret Service had commandeered the room. And we were made to look someplace else in a different building. And we ended up in a -- in a conference room in the astronaut office, over in the astronaut office building. And that was okay, but that was a room that we couldn't even get into without somebody's help because we -- we didn't -- none of us have the -- the clearance to get into that building. But on Monday morning of this week, we were going to do the interview with Hansen on Thursday afternoon. After we'd been told that we couldn't come in here, even after we had shifted the time, on that Thursday morning, we were told that the administrator needed to move his podcast, which had been in the morning, to that afternoon to the same time that our interview with John Hansen was going to be. So, at 8 o'clock in the morning, I'm emailing Hansen in Dallas saying, can we move this to another time. And he said, yeah, sure, but I got to go now, I got to go to the airport. So, that left us in a room that we couldn't really access without the help from somebody who was actually in that building. We went over there in the morning and set up to do an interview with Mr. Bridenstine and the JSC Center Director Mark Geyer, and then had to leave because everybody had other things to do for the whole Vice President Commercial Crew Palooza that was going on. So, the -- by the time we went back over to the other building in the afternoon for you to talk to Mr. Bridenstine and Mr. Geyer, Dr. Hansen was showing up in what was the middle of that interview, so he got to come -- actually come into the room and see the end of that, which was something that we hadn't planned for him. And because we were there later in the day, when we left, we get to go down in the elevator with Doug Hurley, who is one of the Commercial Crew astronauts, who had just been announced that day, so that was kind of a treat for Dr. Hansen too. But it all happened in a way that was not the way we had it carefully planned out, shall we say.  Alex Perryman: Do you know what? That was also the same day that me and Norah had to go do another shoot with the administrator in another building and it was scheduled right after the podcast ended that shoot was supposed to start. So, me and Norah were trying to book it out of there to get to that building before he got there, and hopefully, everything was still set up. And we were -- we were the first ones out the -- out of the room, but they grabbed the elevator before us so we had to like kind of patiently wait and then run to beat them in. And we beat them by like maybe like 30 seconds. And then like the administrator just kind of looked at me and Norah, like I just -- I just saw you guys. And then he’s like wow, you guys got over quick.  Pat Ryan: Stop stalking me.  Alex Perryman: And I looked at him, I was like, do you believe in magic? And then he was like huh? And everyone just started laughing. And I was like, I'm a wizard, that's why they call me the audio wizard.  Gary Jordan: That's true. A flashback to a year ago where I think I first called you the audio wizard when I think it was John accidentally deleted all of the files and you had to resurrect -- literally resurrect the files from out of nowhere, so that's why you are the audio wizard.  Pat Ryan: That's a story that never gets old.  Gary Jordan: Yes, it is. That was -- that that was interesting too because for the Jim Bridenstine, Mark Geyer podcast, we scaled it up a bit, so there was -- it wasn't like this. Like right now, we're kind of scaled down a bit. We have a portable audio recorder, we have microphones, but this is -- we had like the whole set. We had -- we had --  Pat Ryan: It was on video.   Gary Jordan: It was on video. Yeah.  Alex Perryman: Exactly.  Gary Jordan: So, we scaled it up a bit to make that happen.  Pat Ryan: And now it's on YouTube, so you can see it.  [Transition Music]  Jim Bridenstine: Yeah, as we've talked about sending American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, all of that is fantastic, but these commercial crew providers, in many -- they have seats, they have seven seats on their space craft, which means we could be flying tourists to the International Space Station.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: Episode 64 is where we have Norah Moran come on. [Cheers] Yay, Norah! Guys, if you're looking at -- if you go to Houston, We Have a Podcast, the pages on nasa.gov and see all the cool pictures all throughout some of the different shoots and different moments that we've done, that is all Norah making that happen, even gifs and stuff on the last one. I remember the splash was, it's Spaceship Crash Testing, you put a gif in there, that was pretty cool. So, welcome to have Norah on the team. Bill Stafford was a great help as well. Episode 65 with Nick Hague, that was an interesting episode.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: Because what we do to record astronauts is, we have a certain amount of time that we try to get a bunch of different products. We try to get astronaut moments; we try to get all these -- mostly video products but have recently introduced the podcast. And when Nick Hague came on, we knew that his wife, Catie Hague was going to come and we had this idea, maybe we should bring her on the podcast. Problem is, we didn't tell her. We didn't give her the heads-up that she was going to come on the podcast. So, when you hear Catie Hague come on, that is her genuinely reacting to, oh, okay, I guess I'm doing this because she literally had no idea. But she handled it like a champ, she's a public affairs officer herself, so she -- I think she's very much used to all of that.  [Transition Music]  Nick Hague: But it was eye-opening because of that stark difference.  Gary Jordan: Eye-opening and cold. You seem to like cold places.  Nick Hague: I've changed that now, right?  Gary Jordan: Yeah, now being in Houston a little bit differently. At what point did you meet your wife, Catie?  Nick Hague: Speak of the devil.  Gary Jordan: Hey. Catie, you want to come here?  Catie Hague: Sure.  Nick Hague: You can participate.  Catie Hague: Do I have a choice?  Gary Jordan: You don't have to.  Nick Hague: We're doing a podcast.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Catie Hague: Fun.  Gary Jordan: So, was this -- did you guys meet during your bachelor's or --  Nick Hague: Yeah, so at the -- at the Air Force Academy, at the Air Force Academy. We both graduated in 1998, so we were in the same squadron the last two years there. It's kind of funny, you know, we had lunch together every day for two years.  Gary Jordan: Really? As friends?  Catie Hague: Right.  Nick Hague: We didn't -- we didn't get married until two years after graduation.  Gary Jordan: Oh, really? Okay.  Nick Hague: So, yeah, it was just --  Gary Jordan: So, what were you studying? Were you studying -- were you similar programs?  Catie Hague: I was studying law.  Gary Jordan: Law? Okay, so not similar.  Catie Hague: Not similar.  Gary Jordan: But just same kind of --  Catie Hague: I am not as smart on the technical side, let's put it that way.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: But what's interesting about that, Dan, is this sparked a whole series of episodes with astronauts and their spouses, that's when you recorded was with Christina Koch.  Dan Huot: Yeah and it's cool to get the spouses in there too, just because it helps you get kind of the full encapsulation of their story. Astronauts are -- I mean even for us here at NASA, almost these mythical beings, where they're all steely eyed missile men, or insane scientists, and all of these super accomplished people that you forget, like, these are people. And so, having their spouse on and just you learn about the strength of the family that surrounds a lot of these people and the support that they get, and it's like the support that anybody else out there in the world relies on, they're just the same.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, that was huge. I think talking with astronauts, I absolutely love the privilege. I know that was a big theme for the most recent episode, Drew Morgan's podcast, where Stacey came on. My favorite though was Episode 74, Anne McClain. I remember earlier that year, every year, my family does a family reunion around July timeframe, and I ran into an uncle there that actually doesn't normally come to those things, so it was kind of cool seeing him, my Uncle Mike Jordan. And he is a helicopter pilot for the Army and happened to bring up Anne's name, like, you wouldn't happen to know an astronaut named Anne McClain, I'm like, yeah, I think, I think I do. And he said, tell her I said hi. And I go, okay. And in my mind, I knew later that -- a couple months later, I was going to be recording this with Anne McLain, did not tell her at all that I was going to bring up my Uncle Mike, so again, genuine reaction when I brought her up that she was going to be doing that.  Pat Ryan: Yeah, well, you couldn't see it on the podcast, but her eyes got real big when Gary said, do you know a guy named Mike Jordan. And she goes, how do you know him? [Laughter]  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: All right. So, I'm going through the different types of aircraft and I'm definitely not going to list them all, but one of the ones that stuck out to me was the C-12 -- is it Huron King Air?   Anne Mcclain: Mmhmm.  Gary Jordan: King Air. Did you -- were taught by a pilot, Mike Jordan?  Anne Mcclain: How'd you know that?  Gary Jordan: That's my uncle and he says, hi.  Anne Mcclain: Really?  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Anne Mcclain: I was. That's very funny and it's funny that -- because I was actually just talking about him, you can tell him that.  Gary Jordan: Really?  Anne Mcclain: Because he has this incredible way of teaching, where he is very charismatic.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: I think another thing we did pretty well this year was trying a bunch of different live shows.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: If you remember Episode 67 with writing excuses, that was actually months in the making to try to make that happen. We got a tip from actually some engineer who happened to know one of the authors, knew they were coming on, and we just kind of scaled this thing up to eventually, it became a podcast and an internal event where we did everything on stage.  [Transition Music]  Mary Robinette Kowal: That has just come out as a book.  Dan Wells: As a book, yes, it's called How to Invent Everything. And the idea is that if you accidentally get thrown into the past, you will be able to recreate electricity, and penicillin, and all these other things, so that's a pretty nice one to have.  Howard Tayler: So, that book wrapped in a towel.  Kjell Lindgren: All right, so from personal experience, I would say a spoon.  Dan Wells: Now we'll tell you the real answer.  Kjell Lindgren: This is for low Earth orbit, I'm not saying planetary, you know, a spoon is important.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: A fun fact about that one. Actually, I'm -- I actually still talk with Mary Robinette Kowal, she's actually --  Alex Perryman: Really?  Gary Jordan: Yeah, she's actually -- yeah, she's a really cool person and always is interested to find out what we're doing even now and is still an active listener of the podcast. But interesting part about that live performance is I -- or performance -- but live presentation, I was kind of nervous that the crowd wasn't going to react because I was -- in my head, I built up this like grand event and we probably -- we probably got I say a hundred people at the -- at the Teague Auditorium, which is better than I think I was expecting, but it was still like I imagined 700, right? So, before we recorded the podcast, I said, hey, everyone, if you can give a big warm JSC welcome for this podcast, that would be amazing. Okay, we're going to start recording now. Hey, everybody, welcome, to the first live recording of Houston, We Have a Podcast, and the erupted.  Dan Huot: Yay.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, it was great. I know, Dan, when you did the Gates McFadden one --  Dan Huot: That's what happened. [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: When you did the Gates McFadden one, they erupted, and I think you had the benefit of having Gates McFadden there, a highly recognizable character. As soon as you said her name, the crowd went nuts.  Dan Huot: Definitely, definitely helped. And we had -- I don't know if we ever got the final count, but it was a couple hundred, but I mean that was at a big public event.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Dan Huot: That wasn't just a kind of NASA employees thing, that was at Comicpalooza here in Houston, so you could had a captive audience of thousands of people in a giant convention center who were crazy about comic books, and sci-fi, and science, and things like that, so we picked a pretty good spot to go do a great big live one.  Pat Ryan: They put us in a room where they said seated 1,500 people and it was half full.  Dan Huot: Yeah.  Pat Ryan: So, there was a good 7-8 hundred people  Dan Huot: We went on right after Wilmer Valderrama.  Pat Ryan: That's right.  Dan Huot: Which was really -- it was really cool to see him. He was talking about '70 Show and stuff like that, but we went on right after and that was -- that was just an incredible panel of people. You had Gates McFadden, who -- accomplished actor directors, done choreography, a million different things, and was on Star Trek, you know, one of the most iconic sci-fi series. You had Serena Auñón-Chancellor, NASA astronaut, who was just on board the space station, she's also a medical doctor and has done all kinds of insanely cool, and interesting, and unique things throughout her lifetime. And then we had two medical experts at NASA, one of which who's kind of on the leading edge. And one of the things that came up repeatedly during their introductions was none of these people only had one job in their life. Every single one of them was, you know, Gates, actor, director, choreographer, all these. Serena astronaut, doctor, and this guy was doctor, and he was a pilot in Canada for the Air Force Reserve. And then our final panelist was somebody who's been doing space to life sciences for astronauts since Apollo, so just the breadth of knowledge, the experience. And then I'm sitting there, like, hi, I'm Dan. [Laughter] I make funny videos sometimes.  Pat Ryan: Intimidated much?  Dan Huot: But then we had a couple of hundred people and it went fantastically, I mean it was in the middle of one of the Houston monsoons, so we all had fun getting into the center. I parked maybe five minutes away and then Ubered. A five-minute walk and then I Ubered because it was just pouring down rain, but it was a blast.  Gary Jordan: Wow, do you know what? I think -- I was sad to miss that one, but it sounded like a really good time. And I know just listening to it afterwards, I think what was great is that the panel was engaged with each other, they were sort of bouncing off -- and even Gates I think was really -- she was like genuinely curious.  Pat Ryan: She was asking some of the best questions.  Gary Jordan: Right, she was. She was doing great.  Dan Huot: She looked at me 2 minutes in and she's like, hey, can I ask questions? Is that okay? I was like, by all means. Go, make it so.  Gary Jordan: Alex, you've had your fair share of recording podcasts. I guess that was the first time you recorded that podcast outside of here.   Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: But you've recorded an episode of Gravity Assist and you've talked to a bunch of people about recording the podcast, what's that been like?  Alex Perryman: It's been a blast. You know, working on Gravity Assist, I felt, you know, like I was cheating on our podcast because I was like, oh, how -- how can I do this? How can I record someone else's podcast? But it was a lot of fun.   Pat Ryan: Traitor.  Alex Perryman: I'm not a traitor. I came back.  Pat Ryan: You could’ve made a mistake.  [Laughter]  Alex Perryman: Well, no, it's been a blast doing it, and just talking to people who aren't in the NASA community about our podcast and seeing how excited they are about it. So, back in May, I went back to Full Sail University where I went to for their Hall of Fame week, and it's this huge week. This year was the 40th anniversary, and it was the 10th Hall of Fame, and I'm standing there looking at all these amazing people who have Oscars, and Emmys, and Grammys, and what they're doing, and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm the NASA girl here, but you know, I was still excited. And then I had one person walk up, his name is Gary Rizzo, and he just won an Oscar last year for his work for sound mixing on Dunkirk.   Gary Jordan: Oh cool.  Alex Perryman: And he walks in and he goes, hey, I wanted to talk to you about the podcast, I love it. And he started talking about his favorite episodes, and I'm like, what is going on here? I was like no way. Are we really talking about my podcast? I was like, well, I know another Gary who would be very happy to hear you say that.  Gary Jordan: I am very happy, that is awesome. That's really cool. Yeah. Yeah, so what's it like mixing the podcast? What do you tell people about how you actually do podcasting? I guess versus -- that versus like the other stuff you're doing for space.  Alex Perryman: Well, see, you know, it's really interesting because a lot of the people that I talk to when it comes to mixing, they're off into mixing music, whether it's -- mixing music live or mixing it, you know, for TV. And then they ask me, so how is it mixing at NASA and trying to do a podcast? And I was like you have to remember, mixing is mixing, whether you're singing or talking, right? So, some of the same tips. But our environment is a little bit more unique than others, and so I think that's what makes it more exciting and that's what gets people, you know, outside of our community -- our NASA community excited about what we're doing here is that it's like, wow, Alex is mixing, and there's astronauts on here, and there's -- she's talking to all these amazing people. I'm like, but you just did a show with a -- you know, a superstar.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Alex Perryman: A packed house and you want to talk about me doing a podcast that one of them I had to record in the closet.  Gary Jordan: Well, I think that's the best part is that we're reaching like different folks, you know? Like, just with Gates McFadden, right, we're reaching like the comicpalooza category, and with you, we're reaching like the audio engineer, like people who are in film, and wouldn't normally be exposed to like space -- spaceflight and stuff. Episode 68, we recorded with some headquarters folks, Bob Jacobs, Bill Barry, and Bert Ulrich. And at that time, they did a couple interviews at the Cape with people of the First Man.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Pat Ryan: The cast members.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, the cast members, that's it, cast members, and crew, and director, and like all that. And we pulled those interviews in and got some -- got a little bit of Hollywood into the way that we're doing stuff.  [Transition Music]  Bob Jacobs: You know, they said, oh, we have these air conditioned tents, and I got into the first tent to interview Ryan and Claire and noticed that these huge tubes of AC were pointed at the actors.  Bill Barry: Not at the interviewers.  Bob Jacobs: The rest of us -- the rest of us had nothing.  Bill Barry: I had one of those tubes pointed at me, Bob, I was okay.  Bob Jacobs: And it was -- it was hot.  Bert Ulrich: It was horribly hot.  Bob Jacobs: You know, and it's hard enough talking to these people without sweating, so let's just add, you know, the Florida climate on top of it, and it was just a hot, miserable time, but everyone was really good about it.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: I love kind of tackling all these different things and doing stuff a little bit differently. Pat, I feel like this is a good time to bring up the hero's podcast.  Pat Ryan: Master the segue.  Gary Jordan: That is right.  Dan Huot: On another note.  Gary Jordan: Yeah. We've been doing --  Pat Ryan: Meanwhile --  Gary Jordan: Series and -- and different audiences and stuff, this was just a completely different way of doing stuff. Tell me about the inception of this idea.  Pat Ryan: Credit for the start of it goes to that man in the corner, Greg Wiseman.   Gary Jordan: That’s right.  Pat Ryan: Say hi!  Greg Wisemen: Hello.  Gary Jordan: That’s right.  Pat Ryan: Greg is engineering this recording so Alex can sit up here, but Greg is another audio engineer here and he mentioned this story in a meeting that we had and I thought it would be real interesting. And it hit me as a fun thing to try to do. The story I thought was going to require talking to a number of people, not just one or two people, and that made me think of the podcast Serial, and I really liked that in the way that they talked to dozens of people and then find a way to weave those different interviews together in order to tell one story. I think that's really cool and I decided I wanted to try it. Why not? We can. So, Greg helped me contact all the people that had pulled off the trick of rescuing the audio from the Apollo 11 mission control center and set it up -- and set up interviews for all those people. Then the main character we referenced earlier as John Hansen, he's a University of Texas at Dallas professor, and an expert nationally in the field of speech recognition and speech technology. We went through that whole soap opera that we talked about a few minutes ago about finally getting it set and doing that interview with him. And I sat there with him -- we talked for about an hour and a half to try to get him to tell me the whole story of how he became aware that these tapes existed, and how they went through the process of getting them, and then trying to play them and finding out that they couldn't. There was only one machine in the world, apparently, that would have been capable of playing these tapes that contained 30 separate sources on each tape. It's a machine that's right here in this building but it didn't work, and they had to figure out how to make it work. And once they did, then they realized that they had no way to digitize those recordings and to do it in a way that would keep the recordings all linked to one another in time, in terms of when they happened in relationship to the other recordings that had happened. They went through and they finally figured all that out and it's been very successful research from an academic point of view. The National Science Foundation folks were -- crowed about it to us when we interviewed them. We talked to Hansen, we talked to a couple of his students that were involved in it, the National Science Foundation. Some people just out of history that had somehow dropped in on the story through Greg, as well as this long interview with Greg, and he's still getting fan mail from that.  Gary Jordan: All right.  Pat Ryan: Yay! Yay! Yay! So, it was fun, it turned out. I got to talk to -- we used eight different interviews. And oddly enough, the time when we finally -- when I finally got the time without anything else going on to be able to concentrate and pull the pieces together and write the script was during the furlough when civil servants were gone, contractors were still here, and we were allowed to do work on things that did not require direct supervision, wasn't much else going on, but there was that. And that was a task that was entirely up to me at that point, so I got to do it, and it took about a week. But I was able to knock out a script that we then -- with Greg's help, Greg and I were able to mold around and then and take all the interviews and find the pieces that fit together in order to tell the story and in a -- in a cogent fashion, and I think an interesting one. So, yeah, I had a great time doing it.  Gary Jordan: We've definitely had a lot of positive feedback from that whole series because it weaves -- like you said.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: I think that style did the story itself justice because there are so many different elements to it. You're not just talking about restoring this ancient piece of hardware to actually play the tapes, but then there's this whole project to actually digitize them and then eventually do the research. But what NASA got out of it was digitized audio tapes that would have otherwise been sitting on the shelf for who knows how long, but it actually worked out.  Pat Ryan: Well, and two follow-ups on that, if you will, I did not listen to all 19,000 hours of the tapes in order to do this, but I think John Hansen did or pretty nearly. He listened to thousands of hours and when he talked about it with me, he was really -- I found really endearing in the way that he relayed just how cool this was to him to be able to hear all this stuff and to talk about some of the unusual things that he heard being said. One that I really liked was at one point in the conversation, he told me about the great surprise to him when he was listening to audio from Mission Control but heard television commercials from 1969 being played on there, including some for [gasp] cigarettes, it's almost the way he said it. And Greg and I thought that was pretty cool so we went and made a montage to provide listeners with examples of what TV advertising in 1969 sounded like.  [Transition Music]  John Hansen: So there's a lot going on. I will say that, when we first played some of the first tapes. What kind of surprised me, we picked up, I thought one that was probably PAO. And so I was a young kid at the time. But we actually picked up ABC, NBC or CBS news feed on these tapes. I didn't think that you would actually have heard that. And I heard some commercials that I remembered from 1969, you know, there. And I thought, well, this was kind of odd.  Pat Ryan: Breakfast cereals.  John Hansen: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Pat Ryan: Dishwashing soap.  John Hansen: Smoking cigarettes.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  John Hansen: They actually had advertisements for that.  Commercial 1: I'd walk a mile for a Camel.  Commercial 2:  If you don't buy RCA, you may be buying an obsolete color TV.  Commercial 3: [ Singing ] Take me along with you!  I love you little cutie but the office is my duty!  Commercial 4:  Featuring special savings on specially equipped Fury. Valiant. Barracuda. And Belvedere models.  Commercial 5:  When you’re out of Schlitz, you're out of beer.  [Transition Music]  Pat Ryan: And we played that back and that appeared in the episode and it was great, and it was fun. And it was -- that's another example I think of the fun we were able to have with it and not take ourselves too seriously, sometimes NASA does, but we tried not to. I was working through the script in the second Episode and we got to a section where we were talking about how to rehabilitate the sound scriber, this great big machine that, at that point, didn't work, but had to work in order for their thing to be pulled off. I realized that Greg and another guest, Larry Vrooman kept repeating a technical term, we got to do something in order to explain to the listener what that means. I got an idea about how to do it and I said, okay, why not? Just do it.  [Transition Music]  Larry Vrooman: And I tripped over an article in there about Greg. They had interviewed Greg about his project. And back at that time, he was struggling with, for example, the pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: Wait a minute, there's that phrase again. He was struggling with the what?  Larry Vrooman: Pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: I feel compelled to pause here. What is a pinch roller? And why does it matter?  Larry Vrooman: Well, the rubber is a compliant tacky surface. And the capstan, the metal machine, the capstan is not. So the capstan is rotated at a speed that the surface contact with the tape achieves the desired tape speed. And then the pinch roller simply ensures intimate contact. And the pinch roller actually does the pulling of the tape.  [Transition Music]  Pat Ryan: And after I let Larry finish explaining what a pinch roller was, we resumed. I went back to, and now on with the countdown. We'd conveyed the information that we wanted to, we had fun at it. And then later on when people said pinch roller, we added ding, so we had -- we had a good time.  Alex Perryman: I like that.  Gary Jordan: I like listening to that one.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Dan Huot: I mean I would just kind of pile on top, if you haven't gone through, go listen to that series just because it's almost like a national treasure story to me. It's -- when you talk about Apollo and everybody's going to hear about it every single day for the next two months, it's this event that -- it's this crowning achievement in human history and as such, it's just been studied, and dissected, and talked about ad nauseam for 50 years. So, when you find something that has just kind of been unearthed, this hidden treasure and then you get to tell the whole story of how this monumental undertaking just to make it so the entire world can enjoy it, that's really cool, and that's not something that we get to do very often.  Pat Ryan: No. And in this case, what we all -- in the process of doing that, we all -- we unearthed another aspect of those tapes that applied to actually another one of our episodes, the recent episode about the restoration of the Apollo Era Mission Control Room. Greg had explained to me that those Mission Control tapes from Apollo 11, the speech in them was understandable when they started playing it, but it wasn't clear, it had what's called wow and flutter. Alex, you know.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Pat Ryan: That's just -- it's just distortions, right?  Alex Perryman: Right.   Pat Ryan: And the speech was understandable. Anyways, out in the world, there's a guy named Ben Feist who had worked with Apollo audio in the past, he had his own website where he posted all of the audio from Apollo 17, from the last mission to the moon. But he became aware of John Hansen's research and got together with an audio engineer from Europe and they wrote a computer program to correct those errors in the sound of the tape. They broke it down -- I had to ask him this question three times before I could really understand it. They broke down the audio from the Apollo 11 Mission Control Center into sections that the computer could look at and make corrections based on a reference from a timecode signal. They broke it down into 11 -- I'm sorry 8,000 frames per second.  Alex Perryman: Wow.  Pat Ryan: And corrected each of those frames, 8,000 of them per second for the whole however many thousands of hours it was in -- just for Apollo 11 to compensate for the wow and the flutter, that audio was used in John Hansen's project. It's the audio that we used in the podcast, and it's also being used in the actual restoration of the Apollo flight control room. Visitors to go in there in the future are going to be presented with a -- you know, as if you're sitting there really during the mission and the audio that they're going to hear is the audio that Ben Feist and this other guy fixed, if you will, so that it sounds like people were sitting in the room right now, it's -- it's amazing.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, I love that, that whole -- that whole thing. And you can check them all out at exploreApollo.org.  Pat Ryan: ExploreApollo.org.   Gary Jordan: That's right and that's where you can -- you can hear everything. And how all of it is being used in different products, I love that story so much. And I love the fact that we're going back and doing more Apollo stuff. Norah put together a cool page on all of the Apollo content that we're doing. One of my favorites actually was when we did Apollo 8, that one was actually -- there was a gap between part 1 and part 2 because like Pat was saying, that was that time where civil servants were on a shutdown and some of us couldn't work, so we couldn't post the podcast. But Apollo 8, I specifically remember, it was -- I guess more than two years ago at this point, I flew out to Billings, Montana to go interview Frank Borman, but it was for Apollo 1 at the time that was passing the 50th anniversary back in 2017. And when I was there, I got to record some -- an interview with him that was actually put together with a series of people because we didn't actually have the resources to go out and send a whole crew out to interview, so it was just me doing the whole thing, but I remembered that and pulled it for the Apollo 8 Episode, which we recorded with Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, who I'm happy to have on here soon again and for -- for the Apollo 1 actual event that we did and we pulled that from the archives as well. And that's what I think is cool about doing this podcast, as you were saying, you know, we have this format, why not try new things? Let's try the series. We've been doing the live episodes on stage. Dan, you did the one at Comicpalooza. We did them on stage here a couple times. We took panels that were not podcast but would otherwise be cool content anyway and turned them into a podcast, we're just trying different things and I like that. I think one of my favorites though was Shinedown.  Alex Perryman: That was awesome.  Gary Jordan: That was really cool. Thanks to Jeannie Aquino and Leah Cheshire for that one because that -- we all pulled that together. That -- I think we were trying to get Shinedown here, but just the timing didn't work out, but it was still a good conversation that we wanted to have about mental health and it's a topic that is often unexplored, I think, something we don't normally talk about.  [Transition Music]  Mark Vande Hei: But there was times when, on a Saturday morning, I might be feeling a little worn out. And I would just be there. I had a laptop in there. I'd start watching a movie. And that was a nice way to just decompress.  Gary Jordan: Just time by yourself. But you had the weekends. Guys, I don't think you have weekends when you're touring.  Eric Bass: We generally have, you know, 2 shows on, 1 day off, 3 shows on, 1 day off, 2 shows on, 1 day off. Occasionally, we just got done with 2 days off in a row, which never happens. Which we really enjoyed.  Brent Smith: But we can go get a hamburger.  [Laughter]  Eric Bass: We can go get a hamburger. And we’re—right, yeah.  Brent Smith: We can’t—we're not up there.  Eric Bass: Actually, I have a question for both Mark, I think it's for both Mark and Dr. Jim, there. You can both probably chime in on this. So, for me, one of the issues that I have being on tour is my hobbies. So, my hobbies that I love to do, and the things I love to do, really aren't conducive to being on tour.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: So, I was really happy to have those guys on and really open up. And I think what's great about that one is after that podcast ended the guests I had there in the studio, Mark Vande Hei and Jim Picano paused for a second and they kind of are like, wow, thank you for letting me be a part of that. They're like, I didn't expect it -- I don't know what they expected, but they were, like I didn't expect it to go that way, and thank you for having me be a part of that, that was -- that was really, really cool. Guys, this is Episode 99, we're coming up on 100 next.  Pat Ryan: What's next?  Gary Jordan: What's next? Pat, what are we doing for Episode 100? What is the -- what's coming up?  Pat Ryan: Truth of the matter is we're still figuring out the exact composition of what the episodes 100 and 101 will be about, but they are both around the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing -- of the first humans to land on the moon. We have got -- we've got a historical discussion in -- in the plans. We have another interview with the NASA Administrator to talk not only about the past but probably a good bit about the future. I think that that's probably what Mr. Bridenstine wants to talk about mostly. We are also in the midst of producing a second episode in which the voices of the people who are leading the human space exploration effort today talk about how Apollo 11 influenced them in their current careers and their thoughts about what we're going to do next, about returning to the moon slash going forward to the moon in just the next few years, and then going beyond the moon and going to Mars, and God, who knows where else? We've talked to some folks from headquarters and a lot of people from here in Houston, since Johnson Space Center is the home of human spaceflight in America, thank you very much, that -- we're going to have those two episodes on July 12th and 19th in recognition of the big anniversary.  Gary Jordan: All right, a lot of great stuff coming up. I think what -- again, I'm going to reiterate one of the best parts about doing this is we get to try new things and explore new themes. We've done a bunch of -- we've done series, we've done live episodes, we've done video episodes, we've done episodes from space. That was fun when we did that back in like Episode 6.  Dan Huot: Yeah, that was fun.  Alex Perryman: Yep.  Gary Jordan: And we've recorded panels.  Pat Ryan: You know what we haven't done?  Gary Jordan: What haven't we done?  Pat Ryan: A musical.  Alex Perryman: A musical?  Gary Jordan: Dan, how's your -- how's your singing voice?  Dan Huot: Ha ha ha. So – that’ll be the end of the podcast, though right? We'll are on board with that?  Gary Jordan: Okay, we'll go out with a bang.  Dan Huot: Go out with something.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, but honestly, I do like checking out some of the reviews that we get, it's mostly positive and I think we've sort of tweaked the way that we do things and try new things along the way. But if you have a suggestion for the podcast, please make sure to say so, #askNASA, leave a review somewhere between I think five and five stars is the best place to rate this podcast and provide any suggestions on what we should do or what we're doing well and what we're doing not well, the more reviews, the better. We absolutely love doing this. If you want to hear more Pat, because Pat has been hosting a lot more. And --or if you want to hear more Dan because Dan has been hosting a lot less.  Dan Huot: Yeah, I'm realizing that as I got through this. I’m like man.  Gary Jordan: The idea was to phase you out but we had you here.  Dan Huot: I can take a hint.   [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: Yeah and special thanks to you, the listener, the reason that this has gone on for two years is because we've been receiving great feedback from you so far that this is an important thing to do so we will continue to do it. So, thank you so much for listening and downloading and please let us know if you have any more suggestions. I have a cake here that says Houston, We Have Another podcast, let's dig in, guys.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: Here's to another year.  Pat Ryan: Yay.  [ Applause and Cheers ]  [ Music ]  Gary Jordan: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you enjoyed us reminiscing here on what we've done the past year. It's been a great ride and I really hope we continue this for as long as possible. Again, please leave us a great review, or any kind of critical reviews if you want us to do something a little bit different, or explore more series, or more live stuff, whatever you want, it would really help us to think about what we're going to be doing and what we're going to focus on in the future.

            "description": "[Background Music] Gary Jordan (Host): December 15, 2018. It's early in the morning on a Saturday. Pretty chilly, but it's Houston, so it's manageable. Especially compared to where we're going. I'm boarding NASA's Gulfstream G-III aircraft. Onboard is a fairly small group. Bill Ehrenstrom and Chris \"Trigger\" Condon will alternate as pilot for each of the first two legs. Adam Kline, as co-pilot, and Allison Hickey, keeping them in check. Angel Vasquez is the mechanic. He'll be joining us for the duration of the trip, making sure the plane is ready to fly at all times. As for the passengers, there is Kenny Todd, Deputy Manager in the Space Station Program. Kate Rubins, Astronaut, among other things. Shannan Moynihan; medical doctor, and myself, Gary Jordan, a Public Affairs Officer who feels very much out of place. We're taking off from Ellington Field, a small airport southeast of Downtown Houston. It's mostly a military airport. It has some civilian traffic, but NASA also has a decent presence there. It's the same airport where astronauts take off in T-38 training jets, to keep up their flight certifications. We're about to head out to Karaganda, one of the larger cities in the Asian country of Kazakhstan, halfway around the world. From here, we'll be meeting up with a few dozen other people from many nations to conduct one of them most impressive logistic performances I've ever encountered. The recovery of a Soyuz capsule, carrying two astronauts and a cosmonaut, who are coming back from a six-month stay on the International Space Station. This carefully coordinated ensemble will involve an international team, some helicopters, some ATVs, even some SUVs, all rolling out in the middle of the desert in Kazakhstan, called The Steppes. All in sub-zero temperatures, to fetch this space capsule and the crew inside. You're listening to Houston, We Have a Podcast! This is the official podcast of NASA's Johnson Space Center. We talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all some of the coolest people at NASA, and for the most part, we focus on human spaceflight. Today, we're bringing you the story of how a Soyuz landing operation works. The Soyuz is the Russian vehicle cosmonauts have been traveling to space in since the ‘60s, but for almost two decades, it has carried astronauts and cosmonauts from many nations to and from the International Space Station. When the vehicle returns to Earth, it lands in the middle of the desert in Kazakhstan. The vehicle, and more importantly, the astronauts and cosmonauts inside, are recovered by teams on these helicopters and all-terrain vehicles who know where and when they will be landing, and who have a few back-up plans in place just in case something doesn't go exactly the way it's supposed to. To help me tell this story is Kenny Todd, Chad Rowe, Bill Ehrenstrom, and Shannan Moynihan, all who join me on this trip, and go into way more detail on just how everything works. So here is a little bit behind the scenes of a Soyuz landing operation. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: It's my second time flying to Kazakhstan. First time on the Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It's an older, private jet converted into a research plane. Pilots and scientists will take this plane out to different parts of the world, like Greenland, or even Hawaii, and can load a variety of instruments onboard. Some that study air, the water, ice, lots of climate studies. This is Bill Ehrenstrom, one of the pilots that flew the G-III. Bill Ehrenstrom: There was this mission called Oceans Melting Greenland, where we were flying over Greenland, using a radar pod, measuring heights of glaciers. We also had a mission where we dropped sonde buoys out of the back, and measured water temperatures, and salinity, all around Greenland. [Background music] Host: It's very adaptable, and today, it's being used for what's called a Direct Return Mission. All of those climate instruments are no longer on the plane. Instead, it's set up for taking astronauts home, and fast. Two beds, a staff of medical professionals and a plane that can take them to the other side of the planet in a day, right back to the NASA Johnson Space Center, where they'll get to see their families again. And they'll get to see NASA scientists and medical professionals who will be studying how they adapt to Earth's gravity, and make sure they get reconditioned back to \"normal life.\" But on the way over, they'll have an extra seat for me, the Public Affairs Officer. On a good day, my job is pretty simple. Report the landing. While everyone else is working to make sure the operation runs smoothly, my job is to let the world know what's happening. I get a satellite phone, go out to the desert, call into the NASA TV broadcast, and talk about what I'm seeing live, right there on the field. On the bad day, it gets a bit more complicated. But I'm feeling pretty good about this trip, because of who I'm flying with. Kenny Todd has been with NASA for more than 30 years. He's there as a representative of NASA's International Space Station Program, and from the NASA side, making sure everything runs smoothly. [Background music] Kenny Todd: My role there, really, when you look at the team of professionals that we take over there, we have to have somebody that acts as that liaison to Rosaviatsiya, which is the senior leadership group that runs the search and rescue forces on the Russian side. And so, I see my primary role is helping to make sure that our team is getting what it needs relative to, you know, working with our Russian counterparts. [Background music] Host: Kate Rubins is there as a representative of the Astronaut Office. She's been on the other side of this before, landing from space, riding back in the plane from Kazakhstan, and she has a pretty good idea of what the crew will need when they land. Shannan Moynihan is the Air Doc. It's her responsibility to take care of the crew's medical needs on the trip back home. And she is well-prepared to handle that. Everyone else on the plane is there to make sure the plane is ready to fly back. There are pilots already stationed at one of our layover cities. [Background music] Bill Ehrenstrom: The Kazakhstan crew is the crew that goes commercial to Europe, then flies the airplane to Kazakhstan, and then stays there. So, we have two crews to do this. So, our biggest problem here is on the way over, so we have a crew duty day limitation of 14 hours. That can be extended to 16 hours, provided none of the flight is between midnight and 4:00 a.m. from the place you left. We can go to 18 hours with three pilots. So those are our crew duty limitations. Well, a typical mission to Kazakhstan takes about 18 hours to get there, going eastbound. It takes about 22 hours generally coming back westbound. So, there is no way to do that with one crew. Just no way. So, we have to have two crews. We have to pre-stage a crew over in Europe in order to do that.  Host: I get sort of nervous packing for trips to Russia. We're there for so long, and there are so many important items to consider, that I usually give myself about a week to make sure I have everything in order. I've been studying the order of things, and some highlights from the three space travelers' six-month journey that I'll be able to bring up during my short report. But it takes a lot longer than that to make sure things run smoothly. [Background music] Chad Rowe: So, for much of the Space Station Program, especially once the space shuttles were retired, the Soyuz launches, and landings have occurred approximately four times a year.  Host: This is Chad Rowe, NASA's Human Spaceflight Program Director in Russia, who is the NASA lead for logistics on these trips. [Background music] Chad Rowe: And as you can imagine, planning for each of those campaigns begins many months beforehand. So, the earliest stages of planning consist of the finalization of the Space Station flight plan, and this is essentially a flight sequence and schedule, and it includes significant events, including launches and landings of all the vehicles, but also things like extra-vehicular activities and other major events that happen onboard ISS. So that flight planning process is what establishes the formal launch and landing dates, and that ends up being what we go forward with once the Space Station Program manager, Kirk Shireman, and the Russian Space Station Program manager, Alexey Strelnikov come to an agreement on the dates. Those dates can dance around a little bit, so replans are common, but once we know when the rough execution of launches and landings will happen, then we begin our planning sequence in earnest. [Background music] Host: This is Bill Ehrenstrom.  Bill Ehrenstrom: These things take a lot of time to plan. We start them out probably four or five months ahead of time, to start the planning. We are what we call a state aircraft, because we're owned by the United States government. We're a state aircraft. The normal commercial, or private corporate jet can just go pay some fees and go fly anywhere they want in the world. We can't do that. We are, because we work for the government, we have to go through our embassies, we have to get what we call overflight clearances, we have to get these, so these things all have to be coordinated well in advance, and four or five months in advance, we're putting out the requests for overflight clearances. [Background music] Host: I show up about 30 minutes earlier than we were told to show up to the G-III, but I'm still one of the last ones there. Everyone has already chosen a seat, they've placed their bags in different areas, and laid out some of their essential items. Everyone has a different way of doing things. Some folks deprive themselves of sleep before this trip, so they can take a nap on the first leg. Others prepare movies, books or music. Some folks were nice enough to bring breakfast and coffee, a must for me. My job was to bring chips and salsa. I forgot them last time, but I'm going to make sure everyone gets to have them this time. That's one of the big social contributions of a public affairs officer on these trips. But it doesn't come until later in this story. Sure, it used to be a private jet, but for the most part, this G-III has been gutted to make it more practical for NASA's use. The beds are in the back, in between where we're all sitting, and the little breakfast and coffee spread. The seats are pretty comfortable, and the bathroom is pretty spacious. And that's much needed for this 20 hours of travel we're about to embark on. There's a lot of chit-chat up front. Everyone is pretty excited to go get our crew. But after a safety message, taxing over and taking off, it doesn't take much for people to settle in for naps or movies. I've brought water and food to keep me going since we really won't be eating for quite some time. The G-III has enough fuel to get us to Karaganda after two stops. One is in Goose Bay, Canada. And the other is in Bodo, Norway. This is the fastest route, with the most amount of land along the way. If you've ever traveled for 20 hours heading east, you'll know it takes a lot out of you. Especially if your route takes you north in December. You might take off in the day, next thing you know it’s night, then it's day again, but it feels like night. When we land in Karaganda December 16th, it's a sigh of relief, but we're still not done. Thankfully Chad Rowe, NASA's Human Spaceflight Program Director in Russia, for the Space Station Program, who has been stationed over in Moscow, and he's been over in Karaganda for a few days doing the bulk of the NASA work to make sure everything is ready for those final moments until landing. [Background music] Chad Rowe: Well, I lived in an apartment near the center of Moscow, with my wife, Michelle, and my two children, Andrea and Lauren. And going back a little bit, I actually started working with the Russians as a Space Station Guidance, Navigation and Control Integration Engineer in the late 1990s, so I always enjoyed being part of the United States and Russian bilateral team, dating back many, many years, and life in Moscow was terrific. At the street level, there's really no outward animosity toward Americans, and in fact, the younger Russians, most of whom have been learning English up until what I think are teenagers and Russians in their early 20s, they actually like to meet Westerners and practice their English on native speakers. And since there weren't many U.S. Citizens roaming the streets in Moscow, we were pretty easily singled out and frequently asked why we were even there. Usually we were asked in English, which was nice, because my Russian is still pretty bad. [Background music] Host: He's waiting there with a few folks from the Embassy Defense Attaché office, stationed in Kazakhstan to oversee logistics, advice on defense, have a good understanding of Kazakhstan, and the lay of the land and culture. He is there with some logistics folks, and representatives from the embassy. [Background music] Chad Rowe: And then the Defense Attaché Office is able to work directly with the military aspects of the Kazakh government, to make sure that, one, we can share with them what we're doing, what's likely to happen, and let's say mid-term horizon, and long-term horizon, so that they can maintain their credibility and their communications with their Kazakh counterparts. And provide them information and insights that they're probably not able to get in any other way. And as you can imagine, in addition to their important work that they do, being residents in Kazakhstan as the host country, these embassy personnel are usually thrilled to be supporting NASA in exciting and peaceful operations with global insight with the whole world watching. We're on the tarmac waving, and ready to help move luggage and so on, equipment from the aircraft. And so that's pretty exciting, because weary travelers such as yourself are ready to get boots on the ground, and see a few new faces, and I know that after we get you to the hotel in Karaganda, after a short van ride, that nearly all of you, every single time go straight to the room and take a nap. [Background music] Host: Besides Rowe, the Attaché Office, and the logistics folks, we're one of the first ones there. Partly due to the importance of the G-III aircraft, to make sure it's there, and ready to go when the astronauts land. And partly due to learning from past experience that sometimes weather can throw off a schedule a bit. So just in case Karaganda has some nasty weather that forces us to stay in another city for a night, we get there a bit early. [Background music] Bill Ehrenstrom: So, the schedule kind of depends on whether it's a winter mission or a summer mission. The winter missions we've had a couple of times where we got to Europe and realized the weather is not going to allow us to get into Kazakhstan and had to delay. And of course, that then puts the schedule in Kazakhstan is compressed. So, during the winter, the program decided we're going to add an extra day just to make sure we can get there on time, and not have to have a compressed schedule. [Background music] Host: December 17th. The next day is dedicated to make sure everyone else gets there on time. Rowe is busy managing the logistics, monitoring the flight with the rest of the folks coming from Moscow, all the while keeping track of the landing day logistics. Knowing how the crew was doing aboard the International Space Station and looking out for the weather. [Background music] Chad Rowe: So then, afterwards, again, like I said, typically the Russian aircraft will arrive, and there's plenty of NASA personnel that are onboard this aircraft as well, as well as the whole Russian team, and then other various passengers depending on the circumstances, so by that time, we have everyone who is an active participant in landing with boots on the ground in Karaganda. Host: For the G-III crew, their main job is to make sure the plane is ready to go. No hiccups for when the crew lands. They use this day to make sure everything is in order. [Background music] Bill Ehrenstrom: When we're in Kazakhstan, one thing we don't want to have happen is when it's time to take the astronaut home, to find out the airplane is not ready to go home. So, we do check on the airplane. We did have one mission where we had an electrical panel go out that was going to preclude allowing us to go home. And we got a maintenance guy with the panel who flew directly at Kazakhstan, and they got it replaced just in time to bring them home. So, what we do is we go out to the airplane, the first day back, and we start everything up, make sure everything looks good, and we tell the courier he's off the hook. Then, depending upon whether upon weather, if it's summer or winter, if it's winter, I like to go out to the airplane every day, and at least fire up the [Auxiliary Power Unit] APU, get the airplane warmed up, the flight doc likes to go out and make the beds, and we like to get things all set up, but we like to go out there every day, just to check on the airplane. [Background music] Host: For me, it's a good catch-up day. Both for some of the work I know I'm going to miss in the coming week, and to get some extra Z’s and a workout. December 18th, meeting day. This is the day we all gather to make sure everything is going according to plan. And by \"we all,\" I mean everyone from every space agency. At this point, everyone has arrived. Medical folks get together first to go over some of the major logistics of landing day. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: My name is Shannan Moynihan, and I'm the Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the Johnson Space Center. So, for this particular mission, I served as the Air Doc, as what we called it, onboard the airplane, the G-III. So, the medical briefing is a really important part of what we do. So, we are meeting with our international colleagues. Obviously, it's run by our Russian colleagues there, and if we have any international partner, USOS Astronauts onboard, their crew surgeons are also there with us. So, it's also a really nice opportunity for us to all get together. We talk about the crew a little bit, and we make sure that if there were to be any medical conditions of concern, that everybody who is going to be at the scene is aware, who is a medical provider. In addition, we talk about what our treatment plan might be with respect to whether we're going to use any prophylactic medications to help prevent some of those symptoms that can occur when you come back into 1G. And we--it's just a great form for communication amongst the medical cadre, to make sure that we work as one team, which is really kind of amazing if you think about it, big picture. We may not see each other for a year, but we come together, and we've all, many of us who work together for 15, 18 years, so there is a camaraderie there to start with. And it really is one team taking care of the crew as a whole. [Background music] Host: Then, it's the big briefing. They played this video that shows all of the helicopters and ATVs on this map ready to deploy and where they're coming from. It's well-coordinated with vehicles all over the place. Then the video pulls back and shows helicopters and ATVs in different areas from the landing site. It's something I didn't appreciate at first, but when you're going to get people from space who land in the middle of a desert, that desert is kind of like a bullseye, and if something doesn't go precisely according to plan, they might have to land somewhere else. Most likely another part of the desert. And that could be hundreds of miles away. So, they have to have vehicles and teams ready just in case, staged in a different town. They're called the ballistic team.  [Background speaking] Host: Later, a small breakoff team will have a teleconference to make sure everything is set on their end. But during this big briefing, folks from the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, and Russian Search and Recovery Forces get up and present to Alexander Vedernikov, Deputy Director of Rosaviatsiya, and that's the Russian federal agency for air transport. They each touch on an area that they are responsible for and report readiness. Are the medical supplies ready? Are the helicopters staged? ATVs? Aircraft for the ride home. Are all the personnel here, and ready? Note that all of this is done in Russian, so all of the English speakers are given headsets, so we can hear our interpreter, Evgeny, give simultaneous interpretation of everything that's being said. [Background music] Kenny Todd: Well, I'm listening. It's always good to get the medical report of what's going on out in the field, in terms of if there's any hazardous conditions, things that we need to be aware of. It is everything from frigid cold to, you know, ticks, that you have to watch out for and making sure to take care of yourself. So those are things that when I look at the big picture of how we're going to conduct business at the landing site, is there anything there that we need to watch out for?  Host: Kenny Todd and Chad Rowe get up to let the Russian teams know that everything is set from the NASA side. [Background music] Chad Rowe: The main thing that the Russian leads for the landing deployments want to hear from us is insights about our readiness to tend to the returning crew, so the medical teams have to be fully prepared, and at that point, we usually tell the rest of the audience that the medical teams have had this closed meeting before this meeting, so that the coordination was in place at the next level of detail. They also want to hear that the NASA aircraft is mechanically healthy, ready to complete its mission, and that is more than mechanical. That's including possible relocations and so on, that could happen under certain contingencies that could happen with landing. And through the help of the Defense Attaché Office at the U.S. embassy in Nur-Sultan, we have preset approval for relocation of the NASA gulfstream, based on various contingencies. So, in most cases, we will be able to move the NASA aircraft without having to go through formal coordination back with the Kazakh authorities. [Background music] Host: All of the NASA folks get blue flight suits to represent themselves at this briefing, and more importantly, out in the desert. So, in the excitement after-landing, we can all identify ourselves. It's not long until the meeting ends, and the mingling begins. But after that wraps up and everyone splits off to grab some lunch, the NASA and European Space Agency folks get together to go over some of the little details. For me, these are big details. One of them includes helo assignments. [Background music] Chad Rowe: And the purpose of that briefing is to crystallize the plan, and make sure that there's been nothing confusing communicated, especially with the real-time interpretation that has to happen during the Russian-led larger meeting. But also, we're talking about smaller level of details, like who is going to be on which helicopter, both to the landing zone and back, and our communications plan for making sure that we can have tabs on every single non-Russian participant in the landing, as frequently as possible.  Host: Much of the Recovery Team will be flying out in Mi-8 helicopters. They're older military aircraft with few, if any, modern instruments. But there are a lot of them deploying to the desert, and a lot of people on those aircraft. It could be pretty tight. So, if you're assigned to a specific helo to fly out and back, calling helicopters helo for short makes things a bit easier, when you have this helo and the associated number a bunch of times. Probably common in the military, but for me, it's pretty cool. Sometimes you get the same helo both ways. Sometimes it's different. And sometimes the helos deploy at different times, even from different airports. That happened to me before. I was one of the first ones to head out to the landing site, but from a different airport. So, it's critical to pay attention. A lot of times, the public affairs officer will ride back on the media helicopter. This one is designated for photographers usually. Pilots of these helos fly pretty close to the capsule, and land early to make sure that the day is captured in the best way possible. For me, a ride back means I'll be leaving with these guys, and usually it will be one of the first ones to leave after everything is done. So, it's an important part of my job not to miss it. This NASA and ESA meeting goes over those little, but important, details. Including who is riding on what helo. Some of us have been assigned to carry satellite phones. I'll have one to call into NASA TV from the desert. But a lot of other NASA personnel will have them for emergency reasons. Like Kenny Todd, having one to call the International Space Station Management Center, back at the Johnson Space Center, in case anything goes wrong. But we're also reporting when things go right. Anyone with a satellite phone is the communications lead for their helo. We report when the wheels are up, and the wheels are down, letting everyone know exactly where we are, and where we're supposed to be, and when. All from the desert. Usually a lot of logistics regarding helicopters and transportation don't get finalized until around this time, and it's not consistent every time either. Sometimes we head out early on helos and stage in the town of Dzhezkazgan, or Dzez, as many NASA veterans of these trips will call it, which is much closer to the landing site. Sometimes we'll go to Dzez a few hours early and just wait for the landing. Sometimes we leave right from Karaganda. This time, we're taking an AN-26 aircraft a day before the landing to sleep over at a hotel in Dzez. We'll wake up super early from there, head to the airport, where our helos will be waiting, and right about at the time of de-orbit burn for the crew, which marks between 50 and 60 minutes until landing, we'll head out on the helos for the 45-minute trip to the landing site and wait. After a long day of meetings and a big dinner, most folks including me go to bed a bit early. Again, I get nervous that I'll forget something, so I'm 95 percent packed. There's just one issue. When we deploy to Dzez, we don't take all of our bags. Knowing that right after landing we all go home, and that the AN-26 won't be able to hold everybody's things, we travel to the remote town with nothing but a backpack. That backpack will have stuff for the day before, and the day of, landing in December, where I learned in Pennsylvania that layers are good. I have pretty much everything shoved into this backpack when I remember what's going to happen to our larger suitcases. Not only will we not be able to bring them with us, but they'll be stored on the jet, ready for us whenever it's time to depart. Normally this wouldn't be much of an issue, but the temperatures will drop well below zero overnight, and they don't intend to keep the plane running through that whole time. Electronics have a chance of freezing, and I have quite a number of electronics, including a bulky engineering laptop. Guess I'm taking it to the Kazakh Steppes. [Background music] Host:  December 19th. From the next day on, through landing, I would sum up this period as \"hurry up and wait.\" We are up early the next morning to rush off to the airport and wait for the AN-26 aircraft, and the rest of the fleet, to get ready to deploy to Dzez. We've all dropped off our bags and are traveling light at this point. Finally, we get through security and take a shuttle over to the aircraft. There are a few folks there to help guide us onto the plane. Normally this would be pretty easy to walk up the ramp, but with the cold and ice, you wouldn't want to be that guy that slips on his way up. The AN-26 is a military plane, and has benches along the side, and nice open middle for you to throw your bag. Once everyone picks a seat and gets settled, I bring out my earplugs. An absolute must for these trips. These military aircraft, both the AN-26 and the Mi-8 helos are really, really loud. After takeoff, I switch the headphones, and turn on some podcasts to help pass the time. Most folks are leaning back to try to get a quick nap in. Some are chatting, but I honestly don't know how, because it's so loud. After landing, we walk or rather slide down the ramp, to another bus to get to our hotel in Dzez. Our interpreter, Evgeny, is helping us to check in, one by one. We'll have a little downtime before an early dinner, so we all get enough sleep for landing day. Finally, at dinner, I bring out the chips and salsa. I've been carrying these everywhere. In fact, I needed to go back into the AN-26 after landing, because I forgot the chips under my seat. But it was all super worth it. Not that the food in Kazakhstan isn't good. Actually, I feel like it's pretty darn good. But I personally like pretty much all food. But having that little taste of Houston all the way over in Kazakhstan after a long day of travel was incredible. Still, though, I dive into the Pelmeni for dinner. Somehow, I got a seat next to Kate Rubins at the dinner table, who has been in Russia, in Kazakhstan before, for training, even before--after her own space mission. So, I went with whatever she was having, knowing it would be awesome. Sitting next to astronauts, medical doctors, program representatives, photographers, not bad for a last night in Kazakhstan. We all paid for our stay at the hotel that night, knowing that it will be an early day tomorrow, and we will need to rush out. Another early bed time throws me off a bit. I end up pulling up a movie I've saved on my laptop to help pass the time. I pull up some of the statistics and refresh myself on the timeline tomorrow, knowing that I'll have to be on air.  [Background music] Host: December 20th, landing day. After breakfast, we all get changed into our flight suits. Growing up in Pennsylvania and knowing there will be over a foot of snow in the desert, I bring snow pants, that I usually use for skiing. Apparently, nobody does this. So, I'm the butt of a few jokes right off the bat. But I don't take being out in the Kazakh desert lightly. It's blistering cold, below zero Fahrenheit in the morning, and the landing site is looking to be about 15 below. I have gloves, boots, a hat, a mask, and about five layers of insulation. But being landing day, it's not long before everyone is distracted with their duties. Some folks are working logistics. Others are preparing medical equipment. I'm assigned to the helo with all the photographers, so they're getting all of their equipment ready. We hurry up and wait at the airport. Everything seems to be on track for landing. It's our job to make sure we're ready to take off at de-orbit burn. As soon as that burn takes place, landing is like clockwork. Basically, counting down from just under an hour to the time of touchdown. And all of that logistics work to get us staged in Dzez was partly around that, which by helicopter is about 45 minutes from the landing site out to the middle of the desert. The weather is all right, but cloudy, making it a bit harder to spot the capsule coming down and making the operations a bit more difficult. The Mi-8 helos are not new, so they don't have any fancy instruments, and are relying a lot on analog guidance, and line of sight, to find the capsule. [Helicopter rotor sound in background] Host: Being on the media helo, we are the first ones to roll out. I have a satellite phone in my hands, and my government cell with an international plan that will help this all go smoothly. It's my job to report back to Joe Acaba, who is the Lead for Logistics based at the Dzez airport during the operation, and the Space Station Management Center back in Houston. I sent the text that we lifted off, which we did, but then we landed immediately. Apparently, that was a test. Bill Ingalls, the NASA photographer, and a veteran of these trips corrects me and sends the right takeoff time to the Logistics Lead. Good to have a vet onboard. Bill knows exactly what to do on this trip. He works with the other Russian photographers, so everyone gets a good position for taking photos. But it takes about 40 minutes to get to this point. For the most part, we've picked spots around the helo to hang out. I've shoved some ear plugs in to drown out the intense noise coming from the rotors, but like clockwork, the photographers get set up and try to take some photos. No capsule. They're working with the pilots to check where it is. Nothing in sight. Weather reports have shown heavy cloud coverage through the Kazakh Steppes. The landing time passes, and we still haven't seen the capsule. We haven't gotten any reports of anything going wrong either. Everyone is starting to catch on to what that means. Not too much later, the pilots get a call that the ATVs have spotted the capsule, landed safely and upright. Awesome. And the best news for everyone. But at the same time, dang. No photos of the capsule coming down. Still, we are one of the first helos to land. [Background Music] Our pilot brings us fairly close to the capsule. A short walk, but far enough away so as not to affect the operations going on. Turns out we are one of the first helos to get there. Some teams are preparing structures to retrieve the crew inside. It's my job to report all of that, I call onto NASA TV which has been broadcasting the crew's departure and landing live, and report what I'm seeing. [NASA TV Report]: Well Rob, it is a very brisk winter out here, there is a bit of overcast out here at the landing site, so we weren’t able to see the capsule come down, but here I am right in front of it, capsule erected perfectly -- [Background music] Host: Sometimes, there is a Russian video crew out at the site, but they haven't made it there yet. So, my reports of the capsule status, safe and upright, are the first to most. Eventually, a crowd surrounds the capsule. Logistics professionals, medical doctors, program leads, all eagerly awaiting to see the crew who have been living in space for six months. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: And so, the search and rescue folks will go and they're saving the capsule, making sure everything looks good. We're there at that point in time. So, we're watching what is going on. I've been able to go over and kind of look through the window, get an eyeball on my crew, make sure that they look like they're doing well, get the thumbs up. [Background music] Host: A metallic ladder structure is erected around the capsule, and two guys climb up to open the hatch, and then begin reaching down to extract the crew one by one. By this time, the Russian videographers have shown up and will get good footage of the crew coming out.  Kenny Todd: Well, as a person who works very closely with the day-to-day operations, I'm always amazed when we get off the helicopters, and we run up to the capsule, and you can still smell that, they call the Soyuz smell, the kind of burning electrical smell that you can always see after a vehicle just enters back into the atmosphere. It's pretty amazing. And then when they open up the hatch, and you think, I was just literally talking to that person a few days ago in a crew conference call, or else you know, just seeing them on my TV in my office, floating around, and now here they are, down on the ground, and yeah, it's--you know, there's a swarm of people that are usually trying to look inside the capsule, you know, looking for those thumbs up, and it's always good to see three thumbs up from the crew, so, anyway, it's a pretty surreal type of, you know, happening, and it really, like I said, becomes very, very real when you see some smiling faces inside the capsule. It's very cool. [Background speaking] Host: First is Sergei Prokopyev, Soyuz Commander, and first-time flier. Alexander Gerst comes next, European Space Agency Astronaut, and a Space Station Commander for Expedition 57. NASA Astronaut, Serena Aunon-Chancellor comes out last. Three chairs have been aligned right in front of the capsule, and both the chairs and the capsule have been sanctioned off, so media or others don't get too close while the doctors are tending to them. An orange medical tent was constructed way off in the distance, probably about 200 yards away. The doctors, Raxana Bastmanova for Serena, hands satellite phones to the crew with their family on the other line, so they can hear straight from the crew that they've made it back safely to Earth. But with all the crew members seated in front of the cameras and looking healthy, I sign off. In the winter, the field reporter doesn't stay on air for too long, so we don't have to deal with our gloves off, and the phone in our ear, with the blistering cold. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: They go, and they'll put them into a seat, so they can kind of stabilize for a little bit. A lot of that is to try to help with that adaptation back to 1G. So just sitting quietly and still helps with this, the symptoms that can sometimes occur. [Background audio sounds] Host: After a bit, the crew will be carried to the medical tent for some exams. For a while, they were conducting something called field tests in these tents. Beyond the normal checkup, the crew members were to conduct a series of tasks like sitting up and down, walking back and forth, and some other test, to see how they were immediately adjusting back to 1G. This time, they would only do a few medical exams, except for Sergei Prokopyev, who would continue with some field tests. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: You know, so we work to make sure that they're feeling well, and if they're not, we take interventions as needed to get them feeling well and make sure that the travel back, that they're stable for the travel, and just making sure that we're getting them to feel as well as they can for that whole process.  Host: After they got carried into the tent, my job was done. I didn't have the right equipment to enter the tent, and I already had reported the status of the crew. So, I recorded a few sounds for this podcast, took some photos, and then waited by the helo. Traditionally, the photographers have a lot of work up front too. So, the media helicopter is the first to take off. And it's not super apparent when they're going to be doing that. [Background Speaking] Back at the Dzez airport, things are already getting staged for a ceremony. When the crew arrives, they'll be dressed in ceremonial Russian caps and hats, and they'll be given matryoshka dolls, that have been decorated with their image. I meet Dr. Keith Brandt and Rimma Sadretdinova, who were in helos over another part of the desert, on the ballistic site. This is an alternative landing zone, where if the crew needed to, they could reenter the Earth's atmosphere faster, and at a steeper incline. It would be rougher, but the option is there if they needed it. And there were those helos flying around, with medical doctors aboard, just in case. Prokopyev and Gerst arrive to take part in the ceremony, but on Aunon-Chancellor had opted out of the ceremony, not feeling up to the task. This is why it's critical to continue studying the human body during and after spaceflight. Think about Mars. After a six to nine-month journey, astronauts will have to go through similar stresses of adjusting to Mars gravity, and they won't have the convenience of being carried into a medical tent with doctors waiting to treat them and care for them as they adjust over the next several hours. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: You know, Mars is a completely different ballgame. They're not going to have a group there to pick them up when they land, and who are going to help support them for the first 24 to 48 hours, the way we do currently. You know, they're not going to a 1G environment, but still, we're not really sure what the effect of that partial G environment is going to be like on their bodies, so will they have a lot of the same symptoms that we see when they come, you know, back to 1G here on Earth? It's a question, you know? And to not have somebody there necessarily within the crew who can put IVs in and help support them, and until they get, you know, past that adaptation period is going to be interesting. So, what we'd like to do is try to understand the mechanisms, and come up with ways to mitigate, and counter-measure, so that maybe when they get there, they won't have those effects anymore.  Host: I did get a chance on my most recent landing trip to get a few short comments from Nick Hague, who was more than happy to share his experience, despite not being able to sit upright. Here is what he had to say, just a few hours after landing from space in October of 2019.  Host: Nick Hague, welcome back to Earth! I'll start off by saying this, how are you feeling? [Background speaking/music] Nick Hague: I am, it's--so nice to be back. You know, and thanks for the welcome, Gary. It's--it's a little bit of mixed emotions, because I left behind some really good friends, and seeing them, you know, it's going to be fun to watch them go to work up there but going to miss being with them. But that is definitely outweighed by the tugging to get home, the tugging in the heart to get home to Katie and the boys, and just be with them, and reflect on everything that's transpired over the last year. Because it has been a--quite a year. There has been several ups and downs. [Background speaking/Music]  Host: Can you tell me about your expedition, then, what you're reflecting on now, as you're sitting here?  Nick Hague: You know, when I look at the entire year in review, you know, from the first launch, and then following up with the second launch, and in the big question that is, in your mind, is, “OK so I'm back now. Was it worth it?” And so, you start to take stock in, you know, what did we accomplish up there? You know, we did several spacewalks, and proved the station capabilities and extended its life, which is definitely a huge thing. All the different science experiments that we were able to support up there. Whether it's trying to look, you know, at new materials, or new drugs, or just understand biology better, so that we can figure out how to come up with cures to, you know, significant diseases, being able to be part of all of that is something that I never imagined I would be able to be part of, and you know, so the answer for me is that it is all worth it. And now, you know, now I'm back, and I look forward to continuing to be able to support our mission, you know, in a different role, but it's a gigantic team across the entire globe, and it has been a privilege to be a part of it.  [Background music] Host: Back in December 2018, for the expedition 57 landing, the head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, is there to provide comments as well as present gifts to the crew. There are a lot of others from Roscosmos, Energia, NASA, and the European Space Agency, as well. Lots of media. Locals bearing gifts, and of course, the teams from the landing site returning to witness the ceremony. One of the best parts of this whole experience is witnessing people from all over the world. In this one spot, appreciating this moment in history. It's not long until the astronauts are escorted onto their planes for the ride home.  Bill Ehrenstrom: So, the astronaut lands, about five hours later, they end up on the airplane and ready to go. That's what we typically plan. It's about five hours. From the actual touchdown of the capsule until they're back on the airplane. [Background music] Shannan Moynihan: So, onboard the G-III, which is what we were flying on, we have medications to help with immediate post-landing effects, that the crew members might be going through. Really basic things, like IV insertion and IV fluids, and some normal saline, to help with the--any blood pressure issues that we might be seeing, orthostatic hypotension, another fancy term. Sometimes their blood pressure gets a little low, so we can help make them feel better by getting that raised a little bit for them. In addition, we do carry capability, in case we have a bad day. So, our operational concept, we are really trying to make sure that we don't bring anyone onto the NASA plane who is seriously injured. All of those people would be cared for locally. We have a plan in place for how that would happen. So, the flights home average about 18 hours, sort of door to door, for the most part, depending on how long you stay at some of the stopovers. And we do try to make it a comfortable ride home for the crew as well. Often, they're pretty tired. So, we have wonderful mattresses and beds made for them. That's actually part of what I do to get the cabin ready before they come onboard. So, I'm a double board-certified surgeon in emergency medicine, in aerospace medicine, and I make the beds for the crew, to make sure that they're comfortable coming home. We have fluffy, warm blankets. As you know, it can get a little bit chilly when you're in the airplane. We have some of their favorite foods and drinks that their families have often provided, so they get a little taste of home even before we get there. My job is I want to make sure they're getting enough rest. I want to make sure they're getting hydrated. I also participate and help collect what we call BDC, which is some of the science that's being done. So sometimes we collect we'll say bodily fluids [laughs] for testing, and we do that through the--you know, a lot of science investigators want that first 24 hours of data, right? That's when a lot of the changes occur physiologically. Well, 18 to 24 hours of that time they are on a plane or traveling. So, we try to do as much of the science as we can onboard the plane as well. [Background music] Host: Aunon-Chancellor and Gerst will take the G-III over to Norway, where another jet will be waiting to take Gerst to Cologne, Germany. As Aunon-Chancellor continues back to Houston for the quick direct return. Flight docs will tend to them along the way. And researchers will be waiting in both locations to continue studying the effects of the human body in the weeks following landing. For me, I'll ride back with Prokopyev back to Star City, Russia, along with a few dozen other folks from Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency. The trip isn't that long, and I try to catch some Z's on the way over. From Star City, I'll take a short bus ride, then a van ride over to Moscow, and there, I'll have about five hours to repack and nap until I get up again and head to the airport for the trip back to Houston commercially. It's a long and exhausting trip, but thanks to months of organization, international collaboration and decades of human spaceflight experience, the complicated operation of a Soyuz landing goes seamlessly. [Background music] Kenny Todd: It's an International Space Station, and when you get in that area in Kazakhstan, it's such a microcosm of that partnership right there in one hotel. We're all staying together, we're all eating together, we're passing each other and saying hello, and sometimes we're eating meals together. It really, you know, it just amplifies even more what an international partnership we're on. There's no telling when you walk from couch to couch in the lobby what language you're going to hear. And yet at some point, we're all going to get on helicopters, and we're all going to head out into the field, and again, we effectively operate as one team out there, recovering, whether it's European astronauts, or NASA astronauts, or Russian cosmonauts. You know, everybody is acting as one, and again, it's a wonderful partnership, and you really get to see it play out when you're out in the field like that. [Background music] Host: We talk a lot about the work that goes into making human spaceflight a possibility. But when you see it up close, and understand the complexity of it all, you really appreciate it. It's done thoroughly, efficiently, and with the intent of learning how to travel further, to the Moon, and to Mars. These practices and technologies can be brought down to Earth, to benefit our own lives, and to inspire future generations to continue the quest to reach new heights and reveal the unknown. And I'm glad to be a small part of it.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for listening to this episode. I hope you liked it. It's a little different from what we normally do.

            "description": "Gary Jordon (Host): Houston, we have a podcast!  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 67, NASA's 60th Anniversary Live.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So if you're new to the show, we bring in experts to talk about all the different parts about our space agency.  Now, recently we just celebrated NASA's 60th anniversary, and we celebrated on October 1st.  We accomplished a lot during those years, and you can even humbly say that NASA changed the course of human history and inspired generations.  And we did something special to reflect on this very idea.  We took \"Houston We Have a Podcast\" on stage for our folks here at the Johnson Space Center and brought in special guests from the podcast Writing Excuses.  We've sat down with science fiction and fantasy writers Mary Robinette Kowal, Dan Wells, Howard Taylor, and special guest DongWon Song.  Mary, Dan, and Howard have written science fiction books, many of which are set in space.  And DongWon is an editor and a literary agent.  We discussed how 60 years of NASA has influenced works in fiction and even how fiction has influenced real science and innovation.   We also sat down with NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren -- who flew back in 2015, has accumulated 141 days in space -- and he gave somewhat of a NASA perspective of things.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our first recording of \"Houston We Have a Podcast\" from the stage for a live audience to celebrate the 60th anniversary of NASA.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the first live recording of \"Houston We Have a Podcast,\" for the 60th anniversary of NASA!    [ Applause ]    Host: Wonderful, wonderful. All right, Michelle in the back is going to give you your payment, so thank you for that. [laughter] All right, so like I said, today, October 1, is 60 years since NASA first opened its doors.  Think about all the history that's happened over 60 years.  We've seen the first humans fly in space.  We landed on the Moon.  Now we're talking about continuous habitation above our heads.  Anyone -- I mean, how many times have we spit out the statistic, anyone born after November 2, 2000, has never known a time when people have not been in space.  And we get to say that now because of 60 years of constant discovery, including not just human space flight.  You know, how many times have we talked about the Hubble deep field image, how many galaxies and how many stars are in the universe?  More stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on Earth.  It's pretty insane.  But if you think about it, I mean, I personally am here and I'm sure many of you are here because you were inspired one way or another to come work here through something, whether it was something that we did at NASA or some TV show or book.   I mean, how many of you here are Trekkies, right?  Exactly.  I mean, you drew up with Star Trek and you were inspired.  Maybe, oh, my gosh, this is so fascinating, exploration and discovery.  I want to do that for the rest of my life.  Where can I do that?  NASA, right?  It's part of our culture.  And so to do 60 years of NASA, to mark this momentous event, I wanted to do something special for Houston We Have a Podcast, so I have a very special guest next to me.  They host the podcast Writing Excuses.  They're all literary authors, and we also have a few extra special guests.  Starting to my right, Dan Wells, science fiction author.  DongWon Song, who is in publishing, an editor, right?  Mary Robinette Kowal.  Howard Taylor.  And of course, many of you know, Kjell Lindgren, NASA astronaut.  We're going to bring the whole perspective together.  So thank you all for being here today.  I wanted to start because on this idea of inspiration.  Because we, a lot of us here, were inspired to work here at NASA because of maybe something, some TV show or a book we read.   Now we're talking about a time -- I mean, how many space movies have come out?  Many of you are writing books that take place in space and in the future and all these kinds of concepts.  Mary Robinette, I wanted to start with you.  What inspired you to write science fiction to talk about space in your literary works?    Mary Robinette Kowal: So there's two factors.  One is that I looked at the requirements to be an astronaut and just that was never going to happen.  [laughter] But more specifically, I was born in 1969.  And my parents tell the story about how I could sit up to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin by myself.  I could sit by myself, they're very proud of that.  But this narrative of, you know, you set up to watch us put people on the Moon for the very first time was part of my childhood.  And that just sparked I think a lifelong fascination with space.  I remember watching the very first Challenger launch and being amazed that we were putting people in -- I'm going to geek all over the place to people who totally know this stuff.  But the fact that we were launching a maiden, an untried vessel with people in it was just amazing to me.  And then Sally Ride.  And it was like all of these things.  So basically I write science fiction because it allows me to explore all of those things without actually having to do the work of the science.    [laughter]  Host: I feel ya, definitely. Because even me, like I can't tell you how to build a rocket.  I can't tell you all the different things that go into astronaut training, that's why Kjell's here.  But I do love communicating.  It's so fascinating the idea of exploration.    Howard Tayler: One of my very earliest memories is a little tiny black-and-white TV on which there is a man in a spacesuit walking on the Moon.  1972 probably would've made me, you know, four or five years old.  So Apollo 16 or 17, I don't remember any of that.  I just remember there's a man walking on the Moon and my parents explaining to me how incredibly amazing and important that was.  And I grew up in a world in which, yes, it was amazing and important and exceptional and incredible and all of these other things.  But it was also just a part of the natural law.  We walk on other planets. That was the society that I grew up in.  And it's the society that when I write, when I draw comics, that's what I want to share.  I want to tell stories about societies that exist across other planets.    Dan Wells: You mentioned earlier Star Trek.  And one of the things that continually delights me is, you look at Siri and Alexa and Google Home, all three project leads on all three of the major voice assistant AI's have specifically said in interviews that they are doing it because of the computer on Star Trek, that that's what they were inspired by and that they are very specifically trying to re-create that.  And the ability of science fiction and literature and art to influence the progress of human technology and of advancements that we can do is incredible to me.    Host: Yeah.  And it kind of goes back to Howard and Mary Robinette's point.  It inspires each other, right.  So there's the science fiction element that inspires real life technology.  And then you were inspired to actually write science fiction based on real stuff that was happening in the world.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Yeah.  So I'm going to talk about one thing about the back and forth, that particular thing.  So one of the things that's really fantastic about the computers on Star Trek is that the woman's voice.  That is something that there's this interesting correlation.  In the United States, women's voices tend to be the voices of computers.  And when you look back in the history of spaceflight, and the history of computing, the computers were women.  For anyone who's seen Hidden Figures who are well aware of that.  But in the early days, there would be a woman sitting in the launch room and she would be calling out.  They said, computer, tell us the trajectory, and so that voice became the voice of computers.  In Germany, the computer voices tend to be male.  And when you look back in their history of spaceflight, the computers, the people who were doing the math, were men.  So it's this interesting back and forth where real computers, real women, influenced why the sound of that voice needed to be a woman in order to sound right to people who were in the sciences at that time.   And then now we're like, well, the computer on Star Trek, which what sounded like a woman, so now we need to make these actual computers, you know, these AI, we need to make those -- so it's this interesting back and forth where we feed creativity to each other    Host: Yeah.  It's almost like, even though it's, you know, science fiction, that's what's normal to you.  That's what kind of feels right.    Howard Tayler: Well, one thing that's really interesting and important to me is this idea that, even though science fiction can often be about distant futures and all these different elements, we're still always telling stories about us.  The stories that we tell are very grounded in the present.  Science fiction isn't necessarily predictive.  It's a way for us to really understand the world that we live in and the society that we engage with.  So for me growing up -- I grew up in South Florida, a couple hours away from Cape Canaveral.  So whenever there was a shuttle launch or any kind of rocket lunch, we would gather on the football field and stand there and watch that go up.  And it made space and technology and, you know, what we talk about as science fiction very real to me, right.  It was very tangible.  It was very grounded.  Which is an ironic word choice.  But, you know, seeing all that happen in front of me in a space where I could stand and actually see the product of it made it very real.  And so when it came for me to enter the industry, it then felt very natural for me to be working in this area where science fiction is so much the way in which the metaphor for me engages with the world around us.   And so hearing about how the computers on the spaceships are tied to the humans who were performing that role is just a beautiful reflection of that idea for me.    Host: Yeah.  Now, DongWon, in the publishing world, do you find that there is more of a push even now for more stories about space, more stories about technology, about the future?  Are you seeing that shift?    DongWon Song: Space always has a sort of everlasting appeal, right.  There's an evergreen nature to, we love stories about space, we love stories that happen in distant galaxies with spaceships and all that.  And you know, sometimes that can be very distant and a very Star Wars kind of space magic.  And that's not really about space in a lot of ways.  It just happens to take place there.  So it's really exciting that we've seen a shift in the past few years of stuff that once again feels more grounded in the kind of space exploration that we're doing now or, you know, that we can engage in in the next few years, whether that's Mary Robinette's books, Calculating Stars, or whether, you know, that's something like Interstellar or The Martian, right.  These are things that feel really grounded to the world that we live in and sort of reflect our ability to imagine even when it's very fantastical ways in which we could actually get there and ways in which we can actually experience spaceflight and living on other planets.    Dan Wells: Yeah.  I want to talk about The Martian as well very quickly.  Art and science fiction, you know, it always moves in cycles.  And we are kind of clawing our way out of this very depressed era that we've been in.  Depressed might be the wrong word.  But we've had very dark fiction.  We've gone through the big wave of dystopias, which were very huge.  And what we're starting to see now is more stuff like The Martian, where it is getting back to that -- you can talk about Star Trek again -- that original idea of, here is our -- the science fiction stories we are starting to tell more and more frequently are hopeful stories about everyone coming together and using science to solve problems.  That's what The Martian is.  That's what Mary Robinette's series is, The Faded Sky and Calculating Stars.  We're starting to see so much more of that and it's really part of a big thing.    Host: So do you think -- you talked about the dystopian.  I've seen a lot of those movies, read a lot of those books.  It was part of that.  Now you're talking about the shift towards something more collaborative.  Is it because of stuff going on around the world?  Why do you find that this need is now coming up?    DongWon Song: Well, one thing I think is really interesting -- like I said earlier, science fiction is often about the world around us.  And the questions that are really interesting to me when we tell stories that are science fictional are -- they're fundamentally about people, right, and how do people live in these worlds, how do people engage in these worlds?  And The Expanse is a series of books that I was very lucky to work on early in my career.  And one of the reasons I have such love for that series even now as it continues to go on and is on television, is it shows ways in which our current 2018 society, the global politics and the dynamics between different groups, can influence the futures that we live in.  It feels very textured and very grounded in the ways in which, you know, certain groups will still be oppressed, there will still being inequality, there will still be all these things in the future but yet political -- our ability to imagine better political futures will also be true then too, right.  We can imagine collaborative solutions.  We can imagine cooperation.  We can also imagine violence and we can also imagine oppression.  And when you combine all those things, then you have what to me is a truly profound story about our ability to build a better future for ourselves.    Howard Tayler: Fundamentally what I write is social satire.  I'm a humorists.  Schlock Mercenary is a comic strip.  I am engaging the reader with things that's that they're familiar with and I'm using science, I'm using space and spacecraft, and the Fermi paradox and all of this as a setting in which I'm able to look at how the ideas, the concepts, the beliefs, the cultures that we have today would map onto a world in which the background is a lot different.  As DongWon said, science fiction isn't, you know, always predictive.  I desperately hope that what I'm writing is not predictive.  And one of the first laws of my universe is that there's always going to be a punch line, and that's a terrible place to live.  [laughter] But I'm also very, very optimistic, because I love -- I like people.  I like laughing.  I like the belief that while science can't solve our problems, science and the sharing of information can help us understand our problems so that we can change and we can become better.    Host: What's interesting about what you just said was that, you know, you build these characters and you build this environment and this universe around stuff that you understand.  And things that while we're discovering them, you know, we communicate to the public and say there is this thing called a Fermi paradox, there is this concept of that universe expanding over time.  And you can develop a story around this world.  But it's not something that you just invent, it's something that you understand and like, wow, that's fascinating.  I want to invent something around that.    Howard Tayler: I watched -- I don't know how many episodes there are of PBS's Space Time, but I watched a lot of them.  Space Time diagrams, quantum electrodynamics, Feynman diagrams, things that I still don't understand but I love.  And all of it informs the stuff that I will be writing in the future.    Mary Robinette Kowal: One of the questions we get all the time is: Where do you get your ideas?  And for me the question is formulated in a way that is not useful.  Because the ideas are there all the time.  It's how do you get from an idea to a story.  And so one of the things that I think, you know, when you're talking about the Fermi paradox or, you know, watching launches or things like that, that what we do is fundamentally something that I think science does, which is to say, what if?  You know, what if this happens in this way?  What are the consequences of this?  We spend a lot of time as science fiction writers going, what can go wrong?  Which y'all at NASA do very -- a lot of that.  You come up with contingencies that work, we don't.  That's not what science fiction writers do.  We just look at how it can go even worse wrong.  But the ideas are all there.  And so like listening to \"Houston We Have a Podcast\" is incredibly useful for me, because of it's just filled with ideas.   And talking to Kjell is another place that I pick up a lot of my ideas.  It's like when he talks about what happens to the -- he was at the Nebula Awards at a banquet for all of these people, and all of this room full of science fiction and fantasy writers, and he gives a speech about what happens to your body in space, which includes the calluses that come off the bottom of your feet.    Kjell Lindgren: And I do this during dinner too.  But fair warning.  I let everybody know if they had a foot thing that they should stop listening.  [laughter] You know, I think the idea that the ideas are out there does you all a little bit of a disservice though.  Because certainly the ideas are out there, the staging for the stories that you all tell.  But it is the placement of the human experience in there and the framing around the human experience and then the human perspective that makes these stories and these movies so enjoyable.  Because it really helps I think the reader or the participant experience it as almost a first person or a participant.  And I think that is the real joy of reading or watching science fiction and the translating of dry science or situations into something that is exciting and inspirational.   You know, I would say that I know that science fiction, both movies and the written, were absolutely fundamental to me doing this job.  You know, I've wanted to be an astronaut for as long as I can remember.  In fact, I know that two foundational books for me were Saber Jet Ace by Charles Coombs, which was a description of Joseph McConnell.  He was an F-86 pilot in the Korean War.  And then Runaway Robot, which was a little kid and this robot on Ganymede.  And I have pictures of those covers in my head.  And you know, I wanted to be a fighter pilot.  I wanted to be an astronaut.  And did I think that I would have a robot when I was a little kid on Ganymede?  Certainly not.  But this idea of living and working in that setting and pursuing an opportunity like this and being constantly inspired by science fiction and what the possibilities were.   And certainly many of the books I read, I'm glad that we are not in those situations.  But exploring the ideas around that.  Exploring the responsibilities that we have and the use of technology.  You know, with Asimov's rules, the directives for robots, all those things are just really amazing thought experiments.  And to get to participate in those in a small way now with our space station expeditions and with the amazing team that we have here at JSC and around the world is a phenomenal thing.    Mary Robinette Kowal: When you talk about thought experiments, periodically we get invited individually or as a group to go and be futurists at some event.  Which is term that people use when they don't want to admit that they're talking to a science fiction writer.  I'm a futurist.  And so I was at this one for -- at a museum that was dealing with science and industry, and they were talking about revitalizing and ways that they could do educational outreach.  And they're like, you know, one of the things that we could do at this museum is think about what it would be like to send a ship through space with over multiple generations.  But no one's thought about this.  And I'm like, umm.  So it's called a Generation Ship.  Here is a reading list of books.  What we do in science fiction all the time are thought experiments about what is this going to be like.  How is this going to be going down?  And you're right, it's absolutely about the human experience.  And that's part of I think one of the things as well that I've been excited about seeing NASA do, is more of the narrative stuff.   I think that's one of the reasons that everyone is so worried about opportunity is because there's a personality there now.  Even though this is a robot, there is a narrative.  And humans are made of narrative.  We latch onto it.  We learn most efficiently through narrative.  So it's exciting to see those things going back and forth and communicating.    DongWon Song: You know, this point's come up a couple times both from Mary Robinette and from Kjell, but this idea that science fiction helps imagine the consequence of technologies, right.  And Mary Robinette pointed out that here at NASA, it's imaging the disastrous consequences so you can prevent that happening.  For science fiction, so much that is -- what are the emotional consequences that's happening, right?  How is this technology going to make you feel?  And it sounds very sort of wooly when I say it that way, but that gets to the root of why people do things.  People are very reactive in an emotional way.  So when somebody is abandoned on a planet and they have to survive for a year, not only how are they going to do that, but what is that going to do to them mentally?  Why are they going to take the actions that they take?  How is that going to feel?  And I think that's a really important thing in terms of how we can envision the futures we want to envision is not just, oh, hey, we could do this thing, but here's the why of we're going to do this thing.  And here are the consequences of that for the people who are going to be involved.    Dan Wells: As the -- I don't know who said it first, but the line, \"failure is not an option.\"  The degree of planning that goes into putting a group of people on a spacecraft for its virgin flight, for its maiden voyage, is astounding.  Within the more human side of things, I'm all about subverting stuff.  Failure is not an option.  Failure is mandatory.  The option is whether or not you let failure be the last thing you do.  And I love learning from mistakes.  I love that NASA tries to make as many mistakes as possible before there's people sitting on top of a bomb.  [laughter].    Host: That's true, that's true.  That's why we have these tests.  You know, we were talking about just a couple years ago, EFT1, the launch of the vehicle that's going to take people into deep space.  We did it without people first.  We wanted to test a couple things.  We're going to do it again without people first, because we have things to think about.  One of the things you were talking about though is entering into the emotional state, to understand the series of events after something goes wrong to understand how to react to that.  What do you as authors to enter into that space mentally?  To really get into the mind of what would happen in the individual concept, in the societal concept?  How do you get there?    Mary Robinette Kowal: You will hear a phrase a lot of times that \"you write what you know.\"  And I think that what we're doing a lot is that we're extrapolating from what we know.  So like I went to watch a dev run at the MBL, and I'm never going to get in the MBL pool.  But I know I can -- I know what going into water is like.  I know from -- because I'm a professional puppeteer, I know what really uncomfortable positions look like.  When Kjell got out of the EMU, I was watching his hands and was like, the movements he's doing are exactly the things that I do when a puppet is -- the controls are overly stiff.  It's like I know what that feels like.  So a lot of what we do is we wind up extrapolating.  It's like how would I feel in that situation?  What is my lived experience?  What aspect of that is tangential to this?  And then the other thing we do is we look a lot at how people react through history.   There are very predictable ways that groups of people react.  There's cycles that we go through, that the way children interact with their parents.  There's a cycle that we go through where we venerate -- in fashion, we venerate the natural world and we trend over into venerating the artificial world.  And so children who have grown up with parents who venerated the artificial will push back by venerating the natural.  Which is how you go from the information age into the local first thing.  So knowing that when I'm looking at the future and I'm trying to extrapolate like what is this like on a space station that's is permanently inhabited by generations of people, I have to -- I think about those generational pushes and pulls.  So it's that kind of back-and-forth and thinking about patterns that I wind up doing a lot.    Dan Wells: I have just sold a new science fiction series, so new that it's not even in any of your notes.  It's a middle-grade science fiction.  The first book's called Zero-G, and I've sold it to Audible.  They're making it one of their big flagships.  And we've talked about how as science fiction writers, as writers in general, we love to focus on what goes wrong, right?  Because conflict is such an important part of story.  But I have found with this middle-grade series as I've been planning out the whole series of multiple books, that I keep coming back to the idea of, you know, first of all, there needs to be a problem so that we can solve it.  But also where's the fun, you know?  Because I also, just like Kjell, I read those books when I was a kid about, you know, the Robot on Ganymede about the kid who lived in a deep sea base with his father and swam with a dolphin and things like that.  And so I'm finding, you know, well, they're going to go to this planet.  What can I do to make that planet fun?  And so, you know, altering the atmosphere, altering the gravity.   How can I play with physics to create a scenario where we can read the book and say, you know, I want to do this?  I want to be a part of this.  I want to go out and jump around and be able to jump over my own house and things like that.  And so a lot of what we do to get into the, you know, the emotions and the mindset of our readers where we're controlling your minds.  That's the secret of writers.  [laughter] We're deciding what emotions we want you to feel.    Mary Robinette Kowal: He's not kidding.    Dan Wells: And obviously we need to do the research to make sure that our science is correct, and that we are accurately reflecting real experience.  But we're also specifically trying to create that mindset.  We're trying to inspire you, very specifically, to think and feel in a certain way.    Howard Tayler: A few years ago, we did an episode with -- I've forgotten his name….   Cory Doctorow.   Did an episode with Cory Doctorow where we were talking about the neuroscience of fiction.  The idea that when we tell ourselves stories, we can become more emotionally attached to these characters who only exist as fictional constructs.  They exist as patterns of ink on a page, which we then turn into real people in our minds.  And those people are more important to us than some actual real people in the world.  It's fascinating how that works.  We try to only use our powers for good.  I'm speaking only for those on stage.    Mary Robinette Kowal: He's not speaking for me.  [laughter].    Howard Tayler: But it's fascinating.  And so when I think about -- you know, I'm writing social satire.  I'm talking about the future.  I'm talking about -- talking about space travel.  Talking about hope.  Talking about despair.  I'm talking to people who are going to internalize the things that I say.  And I don't want it to sound like I have some huge social responsibility to somehow make the world better.  Mostly I just try to make the world laugh.  But after talking with Cory and looking at the science of what it is that we do, I got a little worried, because it's mind control.    DongWon Song: Yeah.  I mean, one thing I like to talk about a lot when I'm talking about storytelling and craft is that, you know, humans are pattern-seeking creatures, right.  The way our brains are wired, we seek out patterns in the world around us.  And at some point I realize, oh, that's just a story, right.  When we talk about those patterns, we're telling a story about other people.  Mary Robinette mentioned we're sort of narrative seeking and, you know, that also means we're pattern seeking.  And to me I realized that storytelling is how we communicate danger and nuance and complexity to the people around us, and specifically to future generations, right.  So that's how we transfer knowledge down from one generation to the next is by explaining the patterns that we run into.  And that used to be that fire is hot and you shouldn't put your hand in the fire.  And now that is, look at the societies we could build if we imagined this one way of being.  Or look at this how you navigate a romantic relationship.  This is how you deal with your parents or raise children and all those things.  That gets more complicated and more nuanced and more specific with each iteration.   And I think it's a really beautiful thing that we get to do as a species.    Mary Robinette Kowal: One of the things that bounces through my head is -- listening to you guys -- that when I'm thinking about, do I have a responsibility.  I have a responsibility to myself, because the stories that I build are part of creating the future that I want to live in.  And knowing that it's not just me that's reading them.  So in a lot of ways I am writing for myself, trying to build that future, but I'm also writing -- even when I'm writing stuff for adults, I'm writing things for the person that I used to be who needed to read that book, who needed to read that book as the stepping stone to the future that I want to be in.  So it's entirely selfish.    Host: It's an understanding of the world around you, but kind as a learning experience too, as you understand it now and how you want communicate it to yourself before.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Yeah.  Dr. Z was talking about, when he was talking about the Parker solar probe -- I got to go watch that launch.  And Dr. Z said that there's a difference -- that sometimes you do science that is curiosity-driven and sometimes you do science that is practical, practically-driven.  And I feel like a lot of what we do as science fiction writers is that we're doing the curiosity-driven science as a thought experiment and hoping a lot of times that someone is going to come and do the practical work after that.    Kjell Lindgren: You know what's really interesting to me listening to this -- and I'll describe the parallel that I see -- is that, you know, we're talking about science fiction, really the domain of starships and time travel and laser beams and all those things.  But really it's still all distilled down to the human experience and the human narrative, how we tell stories to provide lessons and warnings.  And it's one of the things that -- my favorite things about working here at NASA is, you know, I think a lot of people when they think about NASA, think about the rocket ships and space stations and floating and all those things.  But, you know, for me, I think one of the profound joys of working here is really the team, the people, that we get to work with.  So it really still boils down to that human element.  You know, the machinery is amazing, but it's still just machinery.  It's aluminum and sterile surfaces and all those things.  And so it's the people that are putting those things together that run all of those tasks that have invested time and energy in making sure that these vehicles are safe, that they do what they're supposed to do.   We get to interact with a few of those folks.  In the astronaut office, we get to interact with a few of those folks as we train, as we're operating the vehicle from orbit.  But that is the joy.  I mean, having this -- being one small part of this larger team that gets to do these amazing things: to fly, to explore.  And so, you know, that parallel of science fiction and really still the human element being the most important part in both science fiction and in the operation of spacecraft today is -- I mean, I think that's an interesting thing.    Host: I notice that about whenever we do in-flight events with the crew aboard the space station, we connect with schools, and we've been doing it for a while now.  We're in this year of education on station connecting with lots of schools.  And they always ask questions about the experience.  What's it like being an astronaut?  What's it like to float?  What's it like to do this?  And so, you know, you being an astronaut and understanding that, being inspired by science fiction or whatever, coming back and now being the person that's communicating that, how do you do it?    Kjell Lindgren: You know, I mean, that's a really interesting point.  But I think fundamentally it comes back to the human experience.  I mean, people want to understand like what was that like?  And what would that be like for me if I were in that situation?  I think it fundamentally answers the question of why we explore.  Like why we sent people into the Earth orbit, why we sent people to the Moon, why we're going back there, and why we're going to send people to Mars and beyond.  There's always this age-old argument of, you know, we could send robots.  And I always answer that with the same question of, why would you go to New Zealand?  I mean, if you can see pictures of New Zealand, you know, if somebody sends you pictures as if there was a probe that went to New Zealand, or to the Sahara or to beautiful spots all over the globe, why would you go personally?  It's because of that human experience part.  The next best thing is to talk with somebody that's been there that can explain what the human experience is of seeing those things with their own eyes, of touching the sand or touching, you know, the trees or whatever.   That actual experience of being there.  And so having the privilege of getting to communicate what it's like to live in space, to be in Earth orbit for a long period of time.  You know, that was my very favorite part of getting to fly, was getting to fly for a long duration.  So that I truly got to learn what it was like to adapt to being without gravity and, you know, having to eat and sleep and work, use the bathroom, in that absence of gravity, and getting used to it so that it was a normal commonplace thing.  That was what was really exciting about the long-duration mission, and then getting to share that with folks that are interested in communicating it in fiction.  That are interested -- you know, getting to talk with kids about it.  All these just very human experiences but in a very different environment.    Host: I feel so selfish because I get to have this great conversation with you guys.  But we have mics over here to the left and to the right.  If you guys want to come up and ask a few questions, we'll up it up for some Q&A.  Just line up and we'll kind of incorporate it into the show.    Howard Tayler: It was good of him to spring that on you right now so that you had no time to think about what you were going to ask.  [laughter].  We do this to a lot of our guests as well.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Yeah.  Just so you know, I am totally open to answering any questions about the writing process.  You heard me say the word puppetry.  I'm totally happy to go off topic there.  Although I can actually talk about Apollo and marionettes, which is a real thing.  It's.    Host: Continue.    [laughter]  Mary Robinette Kowal: So Bill Baird was one of the top marionettes, he was the top marionette of his day.  And CBS was afraid that the satellites -- that the images from the Moon were going to fail.  So they hired Bill Baird to create a replica of the Moon landing craft and the astronauts and filmed it.    Howard Tayler: I knew it!    Mary Robinette Kowal: And they used that for multiple -- so for the actual Moon landing, they were fine, they showed that.  But for several of the other -- for several of the Mercury program space walks and for a couple of the -- one of the Apollo missions, what went out over the air was actually marionettes.  And there was a live studio audience as well.  So there are people who -- I think this is where that seed of, no, no, they did with marionettes.  I think that there was someone who as a kid who actually saw that and didn't understand that everyone knew that it was marionettes.  Because it said at the bottom of the screen, you know, \"this is a simulation.\"  Yeah.  So actual marionettes.  They still exist, the marionettes exist.    Host: Where?  I want to find them.    Mary Robinette Kowal: I can give you that information.  And there's a picture of them in the book, Marketing the Moon.  There's a picture of one of those broadcasts.  It's the only existing picture.  Someone took a picture of the screen, so there's no footage of the broadcast, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending -- because the Moon hoax people would just be all over that.    Host: So I'm guessing that -- we're going off of this topic of human.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Sorry.    Kjell Lindgren: Tangent.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Sorry about that.    Host: We're talking about the human experience, but that kind of makes me think of research, right.  You were talking about writing off what know.  But how far do you go into researching and understand what you don't know and then incorporating that into your story?    Howard Tayler: I am a big fan of the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the un-unknowns, the unknown unknowns model, because it means that I just have to listen and learn everything.  Because I don't know what -- I don't even know what questions to ask until I've started soaking things up.  I am fortunate in that a good 60 to 70% of the time that I spend creating is not spent using the part of my brain that has to make words.  I'm drawing pictures.  And so, you know, when I said I plowed through, you know, three years of PBS's Space Time, I did that while I was drawing.  I was working.  I was not sitting there doing research.  I was sitting there letting research enter me while I got other work done.  Which is probably why I need to watch it again, because I missed some of the important diagrams.  I love that, because at the end of a drawing session, instead of just having, you know, a sore hand and a stack of comics, I have a sore hand and a stack of comics and a big list of questions that I get to go try and find answers to.    Dan Wells: One of my series that I've done is a post-apocalyptic YA trilogy where the apocalypse was a plague.  So people got sick.  And one of the big plot threads is, we need to cure this.  And I realized as I was outlining, that I never wanted to write the sentence, \"then she did some science and cured the plague,\" you know.  [laughter] And so I had to do so much research into medicine and biology and virology and how could this thing function and how could a scientist study it and get it wrong a couple of times and then figure out how to do it and then solve it.  And that's what I really love about science fiction.  And that's what shows up at some point in all of my books, is Dan did all this science -- first of all, he wants to make sure you knew he did all this science. [laughter]  But second, you know, finding ways to actually turn that into a story so that you can learn something about virology that's super cool that I found while I was studying it.    DongWon Song: I find that there's two kind of modes of research.  One is the very active mode research, which Dan just described in terms of studying humanology or orbital mechanics or whatever it is.  But then there's a thing that I find really delightful as I get to spend a lot of time with writers -- which is sort of passive research -- and that is that thing that anytime you're with a group of writers, at some point in the conversation will turn to, do you want to know what cool fact I just learned?  And it just it's like kids at a lunch table sitting around and just telling you about a weird thing they found out about an animal or a weird thing about space.  Or just talking about cool stuff, and then that can be such fuel for your waiting or anything you want to put into your book, or even just the seed for a really amazing story idea.    Kjell Lindgren: You know, as a consumer of science fiction, I would say that when there is active research and the author is clearly done homework to at least present a plausible solution, I mean, that really comes through.  And I really enjoy that.  You know, we talked about The Martian a little bit earlier.  So I read the book before I flew and we actually got to watch the movie on orbit, which was phenomenal.  But it was clear that the author, that Andy Weir, did a lot of research and a lot of that made it into the book and made it realistic.  I think, you know, it doesn't always have to be realistic.  But for me at least, there has to be rules.  So if it's, you know, future thinking and some neat gadget, it still has to have rules that surround it and it can't be, you know, and then the box produced the solution for the problem, and you know, everybody was happy.   So I love the brainstorming and the futurism about science fiction and what could be.  But, you know, as long as it still fits within the paradigm -- the rules of that world, it's fun.  When it exceeds that, then you're kind of like, well, that was a waste of time.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Yeah.  I do a lot of the kind of layered research that Dan is talking about.  But I also cheat a lot.  So I'll hit a scene, particularly in the Calculating Stars books, and I'll write something that's like, and then the captain said, jargon as he jargons the jargon.  [laughter] And put it in square brackets and then I'll email it to Kjell and say, can you play mad libs?    Host: See a little bit of help comes in. I think we have a question from the audience.    Audience Member: So Douglas Adams always told us to bring a towel.  What do you recommend we take on our adventures?    Howard Tayler: A spare towel because the first one gets dirty really quickly, surprisingly quickly, frighteningly, frighteningly dirty.    Mary Robinette Kowal: So I always recommend good hydration.  One of the things for the people who are in the live audience is that I have a notebook up here.  I always carry a notebook with me so that I can jot down the thing that's like, that's super cool.  And later, I don't have to go through the process of like, oh, someone told me this super cool thing and I remember like three parts of it but not the fourth.  I can actually just jot them down as people are talking.    Dan Wells: There's another web cartoonist named Ryan North who does Dinosaur Comics.  And he created and sells a T-shirt that includes on it all of the instructions in very small print to reinvent most of our modern technologies.  And he sells it as the special T-shirt for time travelers.    Mary Robinette Kowal: That has just come out as a book.    Dan Wells: As a book, yes.  It's called How to Invent Everything.  And the idea is that if you accidentally get thrown into the past, you will be able to re-create electricity and penicillin and all these other things.  So that's a pretty nice one to have.    Howard Tayler: So that book wrapped in a towel [laughter].    Kjell Lindgren: All right, so from personal experience, I would say a spoon.  [laughter].    Dan Wells: Now we'll tell you the real answer.    Kjell Lindgren: This is for low Earth orbit.  I'm not saying planetary, you know.  A spoon is important.  Never pass up a meal.  And then scissors.  So we get issued a Leatherman, you know, a multitool that we have with us.  We have all sorts of tools.  And I would say that 99% of the time, just a pair of scissors was the handiest thing that I could've kept with me.  I used that multiple times a day.  I probably use the multitool maybe five times total during the entire expedition.  But I cut a little hole at the top of the multitool holster and then tuck the scissors in there, put a lanyard on it.  Oh, and you have to have a lanyard tying -- you know, obviously connecting whatever it is that you're using to your body.  Because my radiation, personal radiation device, upon arriving to orbit, they were very clear about, you've got to keep this on you at all times.   You know, this is the only one you have, there's no backups.  So I of course stuck it in my pocket, thinking, I'll figure out a way to attach this to myself at some point.  And then spent a good two hours looking for it, terrified of having to make, you know, my first call down to mission control, hey, I already lost the personal radiation device [laughter].  Thankfully I found it in one of the multitude of pockets that we have on our khaki cargo pants.  But I immediately then wire tied that to my -- to the multitool holster as well.  So I basically had that thing with me the whole time.  But the scissors are super important.    Howard Tayler: Can I ask why -- if you only get one, and everybody gets one, and everybody only gets one, and everybody who goes on to the spaceship gets one, why isn't there one solution for keeping that one thing on your one person?    Kjell Lindgren: That is a great question.  They're relying on I guess our ingenuity to.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Well [laughter].    Howard Tayer: Make checks payable to.    Kjell Lindgren: Patented personal radiation device holster.    Howard Tayler: I call it string.    Kjell Lindgren: We use wire ties.  We're not going to stoop to string.    Mary Robinette Kowal: Yeah.  And string is not an acronym.    Kjell Lindgren: Could be.  I'll work on that.    Dan Wells: He's going to spend the next few minutes thinking about one.  We have another question though.    Audience Member: Is there a particular NASA mission that has inspired your writings more than others?  Or is it just NASA's collective goal of exploring the unknown?    Dan Wells: For me, like we said, writers love to think about what goes wrong so that we can solve the problems.  And so you all know now after that introduction that I'm going to talk about Apollo 13, which is a disaster and things went wildly wrong.  But it is also such an incredible testament to ingenuity, to preparedness, to solving these incredible conflicts on the fly because you've already assembled the right people and you know what to do and you're able to think outside the box.  And I find it an incredibly moving and inspiring story.    Howard Tayler: I grew up on the West Coast of Florida.  16 years old, driving to school one morning, and there is a pillar of fire reaching into the heavens, terminating in a little tiny point.  And I'm convinced, you know, I'm seeing, you know, the flame from the launch.  And it's explained to me, no, that's not the flame, that's just contrails and gas and it's being lit by a Florida sunrise.  So beautiful.  So awe-inspiring to see from across the state us reaching up with this fiery finger and touching the heavens.  That sense of wonder belongs in everything I do at some point.  I can't draw that picture in a way that will inspire readers the way that sight inspired me, but I can try to make up other stuff that comes close.    DongWon Song: Having spent all this time talking about the importance of people and narratives and feelings, I'm now going to talk about an inanimate object.  And I will sometimes lay awake at night thinking about the Voyager space probe and this infinitesimally small thing in this infinitely large universe, just broadcasting its little message and going out there.  And to me it's just this really beautiful image and very powerful for reasons that I'm not sure I can articulate.  But it's just, it's out there, and it's going to keep going.  And that is so amazing.    Mary Robinette Kowal: We've already touched on a couple of things that I was personally excited about.  But the video of the Seven Minutes of Terror was so like such -- I was watching that live.  There were people -- I live in Chicago.  And there were people -- there were bars showing that.  Like you could go to a bar -- and had I known that at the time, I totally would've been in a bar instead of my living room watching that.  But I was watching it and like all of my friends were on Twitter and we were all sitting there rooting for that.  And just it was like when we knew that it had worked, and everyone that I knew was cheering, it was like, yes, this is science!  [laughter].    Host: We have another question in the audience.    Audience Member: I have a three-part question for the panelists.  First of all, did you go to college?  Or was there some other postsecondary training that you did?  Secondly, what was the emphasis or major of that training?  And then thirdly, what courses or instruction has been most helpful to you in your career as writers and editors?    Howard Tayler: I studied music, because the graduates of the chemical engineering program all came back to lecture to us and they were all dumpy, short, bald guys.  And I thought that music would make me cooler.  This is a true story.  I went into software middle-management and at some point realized that at my heart I was a storyteller.  And how hard can it really be to learn to draw comics?  And the answer is, harder than I think.  The one thing that I learned that -- or the one piece of knowledge that I had at that point that made any of this possible is that I could learn to do it better.  The thing -- honestly, the postsecondary, post whatever training that's been most valuable to me -- and this is going to sound a little bit like sucking up -- is being on the podcast with Dan and Mary and Brandon and DongWon and many of our other guests.  Because I'm the cabbage head.  It's my job to learn everything and maybe sum it up in a pithy way.  And I'm still learning as I listen to my friends.    Mary Robinette Kowal: I don't have a degree.  I was an art major with a minor in theater and speech.  And for years I would mask that because I felt really inferior, especially when I'm sitting in a room where I know there are multiple PhDs and some of you have multiple, multiple PhDs.  It's not fair.  But I left college to do an internship at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia and went on to have a 25-plus year career as a puppeteer.  So I've done everything from touring into elementary schools to Little Shop of Horrors, which is 125 pound puppet at a time in my life when I weighed 127 pounds, to Sesame Street.  I've done film.  I've done some television.  And for me the thing that has been most useful in my life has been learning how to communicate to an audience.  I've been able to take that into every other thing that I've done.  And specifically there have been two pieces of advice from puppet theater that -- well, one of them is actually my dad, but I've used it in puppet theater.  Which is done right or done over.  That you do it, and if it's not right, you do it over.  And that you can iterate to being what you want to be.  The other thing is that, in my field, that you shoot for 100%.  This is something that my mentor said, that you shoot for 100% every time, but that you learn to be happy when you're hitting 80%, that you've actually had success.  That just because there's been one failure doesn't wipe out all of the other failures that have happened.  And those two things have allowed me to just keep going even when what I'm working on doesn't succeed.  I just try it again.    DongWon Song: So I have a double major in English and economics as my undergraduate degrees.  And that sounds like the perfect setup to be a literary agent, which is what I am.  And you know, that double major or econ came about just because when your parents are Asian American immigrants and you call them to say, I am quitting my engineering program, you need something so that they don't actually disown you on the spot.  And you know, I have found that the econ degree actually helped me more than the English degree in a lot of what I do, but not because it makes me good at business.  Because economics isn't really about how to do business.  It has taught me how to think in systems.  And when you think about systems and you work in science fiction and fantasy, world-building is really important.  So it allows you to ask the question of, if we make this one change, what are going to be the knock-on effects for that, right?  If we change this global variable, what happens to the people who live in this world?  So I use my econ degree all the time to think semi-rigorously as far as fiction requires about what are the consequences of the rules in the world that we're imagining in.  How do we make sure we're building an internally consistent story?    Dan Wells: I have -- in undergraduate, I have one year of -- I studied archaeology for one year and then English for two years, and that ended up being a bachelor of arts in English and editing, because the archaeology didn't really count for anything.  It was awesome though and I love it.  The most important thing that I think, the part that I keep going back to as I'm listening to these other stories, is actually something that my fifth grade teacher taught me.  Which was how to spell pneumono¬ultra-microscopic¬silico¬volcano¬coniosis.  And I say that in all seriousness.  I think it is arguably the most valuable thing I've ever learned.  Because it taught me, first of all, how words work and how to read a new word and figure out how to say it and what it means.  It taught me that I can do that, that I can explore something new, that I can learn something new, that I can figure something out on my own, and that I don't have to be afraid of big words.   And I 100% guarantee you that there is a very direct through line from that fifth-grade teacher to me being an author today.    Howard Tayler: I had not heard the story about that long word that I can't pronounce.  I also hadn't heard about the archaeology stuff.  And it occurs to me that, you know, learning to dig up and learn about bodies helps you hide them.  [laughter].    DongWon Song: It also explains the hat.    Dan Wells: Yes.  For those not benefitting from the video feed, that's a joke we make on our show.  I don't know if we make that on your show because maybe there is one or maybe now we'll get in trouble for not having one.  But I do, I have an Indiana Jones style adventuring fedora as part of my author uniform so that people recognize me.  Yes, I studied archaeology for one year in college.  And there you go.    Host: Well, as weird as it is, I think that's a perfect place to end [laughter].  Hey, how about a big JSC round of applause for our panel today?    [ Applause ]    I expected nothing less than an amazing discussion from you guys, and that's exactly what we got.  I think it was a perfect way to celebrate 60 years of NASA and the inspiration that comes with it.  So I very much appreciate you coming on the show today.  Thanks to our audience.  Kjell, thank you for making some room in your schedule for this.  And with that, we'll wrap up.  Thank you.    [ Applause ]    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  That was a really fun conversation we had on stage for the 60th anniversary of NASA.  I was really proud to bring them on and have a discussion about science fiction.  Because really that inspired a lot of folks here on the site.  And you can even tell in the audience, people were really excited that we got to chat with those folks.  So if you want to learn more about the 60th anniversary of NASA, we have a website, NASA.gov/60.  You see what happened across all the other centers all over the United States here for the 60th anniversary of NASA.  We have other podcasts you can listen to across the agency as well.  We have Gravity Assist over at headquarters about Planetary Science, NASA and Silicon Valley, and of course, Rocket Ranch.   You go to NASA.gov/ISS to find out what's happening on board the International Space Station all the time.  On social media, you can visit our NASA accounts, NASA Johnson Space Center accounts.  In either case use, the #askNASA on your favorite platform -- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, whatever.  Submit an idea for the show.  Make sure to mention it's for \"Houston We Have a Podcast.\"  This episode was recorded on the 60th anniversary of NASA on October 1, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, John Stoll, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Norah Moran, Jeannie Aquino, Linda Matthew Schmidt, Brandi Dean, Megan -- honestly, I'm sorry, I'm going to leave off a lot of people here, I don't think I can get through everyone.  But truly thanks to everyone who participated to actually make this happen.  It was a big deal.  Greg Wiseman, Eric Gambrell, just so many people.  Also thanks to Mary Robinette Kowal, Dan Wells, Howard Taylor, and DongWon Song for taking time out of their schedule and come on to share their insights with the NASA community and with the listeners of \" Houston We Have a Podcast\" for the 60th anniversary of NASA.   Very proud to spend it with you guys.  And of course, thanks to Kjell Lindgren for taking the time as well.  He actually adjusted his schedule to be with us today.  So I really appreciate his time and his out of this world perspective.  Happy 60th anniversary to NASA.  We'll be back next week.",

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 192, “Drive Like a Martian.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. You don't hear very often that it's time to \"reinvent the wheel,\" but when that wheel is spinning on another planet, it might be a good idea. Tires from Mars are going to have to deal with rocks, sand, slopes, craters, and cold. So, the idea of a wheel becomes a bit more complex as you start to realize what has to go into the design to deal with all of that. So, today, we dive into the history of space tires, and discuss work being done for an innovative new tire for Mars called the Spring Tire. Joining us from Glenn Research Center is the Mars Spring Tire Project Manager Dr. Yajaira Sierra-Sastre, and the Lead Tire Engineer Vivake Asnani. So, let's jump right in to learn what it takes to drive like a Martian. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Yajaira and Vivake, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Vivake Asnani: Hey, excited to be here.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Hello, Gary, thank you for having us.  Host: Hey -- great to have both of you guys. So, this is a very interesting topic, Martian Tires, and we're going to get into a lot of the -- we're going to start with the history, talking to you guys a head of time. And we're going to actually reveal what is a tire, what is that especially in the space environment, and then get to some of the super cool technology that you guys are working on. Yajaira, I want to start with you. What is your background? How'd you get involved in tires, particularly with your materials science background?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, that's a very interesting question. And I don't have a really traditional path to NASA, but I can tell you that I am a materials chemist by training. I have a Ph.D in materials chemistry. And back in grad school I focused on the synthesis and structural evolution of nanoscale materials from molecular thin films to metallic and semiconductor nanostructures. And prior to joining NASA Glenn I worked for two startup companies specializing in nanomaterials for different types of industries and applications from textiles to biomedical applications. And most recently I also served as a civil servant. I worked as a project manager for the U.S. Bureau for Engraving and Printing, that's our U.S. money factory. And there I led material science projects to keep our U.S. bank notes secure. Nothing related to space, but space has always been my passion, so while looking for opportunities to transition my career to the space sector, back in 2013, I was part of a Mars analog mission funded by NASA -- the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation. And was their contact crew member for four months in -- a habitat in Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. But, besides that analog and that simulation, I also established collaborations with Johnson Space Center for an exercise work study. So, we were looking at Mars garments and intravehicular clothing for astronauts -- for ISS. So, these experiences plus other you know, other types of opportunities provided to us over the years like, taking planetary geology courses and trying to get, gain more field work experience related to Mars exploration, I believe that my path to now serve as NASA Glenn. So, when the opportunity came my way to manage this project I -- just said, yes. And in the context of these Mars Spring Tires Project, I am the project manager for -- the project, for -- and as -- you will learn through these conversations; we are part of that -- the Mars Sample Return mission, part of the Sample Retrieval Lander Project, we are delivering, will be building and delivering the new tires and wheel and tire assemblies that will be integrated with a Sample Fetch Rover. So, my goal as a project manager, and my role and responsibilities to make sure our team executes and successfully deliver these -- tire, wheel and tire assemblies to ESA (European Space Agency).  Host: I can't wait to get into this topic. I'm curious though, it seems like -- you say, you have kind of a roundabout path to get into NASA. I wonder what -- maybe, and earlier in your life, there was something that maybe, that maybe triggered some spark that was, that you were thinking, \"Hey, NASA is somewhere that I want to go. I want to work in the space sector.\" Do you have a moment like that in your -- earlier life?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Oh, yes, definitely. I think since my earlier years, like since I was very young, and my first passion and my first love was astronomy and planets and stars. I am originally from Puerto Rico, so growing up in that beautiful island and just staring at the night sky really influenced me, instill in me the passion for science.  Host: Wonderful. Wonderful. I'm glad to have you on today, Yajaira, and -- Vivake, you are bringing to the table a mechanical engineering background, tell us a little bit about yourself.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah, actually -- you know, going into school I wanted to work on acoustics, so I started in electrical engineering, and then in graduate school did mechanical engineering. My path really wasn't directed towards NASA -- they recruited me. And when I got to NASA, we were just going back to the Moon, right. So, we hadn't really thought about Moon rovers in a while, there wasn't going on that, in that area. And I -- found myself in this meeting where we were trying to figure out how to land a nuclear reactor on the Moon and get it away from the lander. So, we're starting to think about mobility on the moon, and -- kind of looking at each other not really knowing how to handle this problem. And that just sent me down a rabbit hole, and since then, I've been really interested in mobility on other planets.  Host: That is awesome. And this is like the ultimate -- mobility, right. Now we're going to be talking about driving like a Martian, there's -- you know, a history here when it comes to -- this type of mobility, Vivake, that you're talking about on other planets. Let's -- before we go into the history though, set a foundation for what we know about tires on other planets, and how they work. Give us a little bit of, you know, the what is, when it comes to tires.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah. If I could start with Earth tires. We didn't always have them, we used to roll on rigid wheels, like wagon wheel type of things. And, you know, the pneumatic tire was a breakthrough, it was invented like 130 years ago, and its purpose was to create flexibility. And it helps in a couple ways. First, if you're not on a road, and you need to gain traction; the larger contact area really helps you. But something that's not really appreciated is, it also saves you a lot of energy. So, a vehicle on wagon wheels is going to -- going to go up and down quite a bit as it goes over rocks, but the tire, it actually conforms to the surface, and saves the vehicle all that energy that it takes to go up and down. So, that's -- on Earth, you know, we always use tires now. Looking to other planets though, you look to Mars or the Moon where it can get very cold, we can't use the rubber. And we also don't want to use the air, because that's a single point of failure, and -- as NASA missions go, we don't like to have single points of failure.  Host: That's right, you know, you -- get that punctured tire, right, that -- when you're driving down the highway on Earth, you just pull over to the side of the road, and you -- call AAA or some insurance company, they bring up, pump up your tire, change it out for you, whatever, maybe even tow it. You know -- don't have that service on another planet as much. So, you know, let's think about some of the  tires we know from the past, right. So, this problem, right, you don't want a single point of failure, what are some of the tires that -- or some examples of tires in the past that sort of shaped this narrative of what a space tire would look like?  Vivake Asnani: Yeah, so, this problem, obviously was new to the people that were working on the Apollo program and the precursors, as well as, you know, in the Soviet Union, they were seeking to land a rover on the Moon. And you know, the real issue was you couldn't take the regular Earth tire and get the same kind of performance, and you have the risk of the puncture. The Soviet Union sent a rover called -- Lunokhod, or moonwalker and they just made the decision, we're going to use rigid wheels, we're not going to handle the problem with flexibility. But, you know, with that comes performance limitations, and it was unmanned, so not as much risk. But the Americans, we decided we were going to go for a flexible tire. Yajaira might be able to explain better, but Goodyear actually produced a pneumatic tire to start before we even got into the woven wire tires that we'll talk about today. Yajaira, you want to tell us more about that?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, so, I wanted to add to the history of tires before -- I get to -- that topic, that, as a material scientist, one of the things that I consider very interesting in evolution of the tire is that, that evolution has been driven by the need for better material. So, Vivake was talking about, you know, these rigid wheels that were used, right. And initially, tires were made of leather bands, and then replaced with steel, and eventually as Vivake mentioned, rover, right. The rover material was tuned in such a way to make it more a pliable material, and the material of choice for tires. So, all those materials advancements have -- had a really, really impact and have driven these type of evolutions of tires. And besides the Russian Lunokhod tires -- back in the Apollo era, there were different types of tire -- wheel and tire families, and tires that were developed for different types of purposes. So, we had the LRV, the Lunar Roving Vehicle, that which we can explain in more detail. And also, another type of vehicle called the Modularized Equipment Transporter, MET, which its function, is -- was basically carrying equipment and samples collected by the astronauts on Apollo 14. So, depending on the functionality, the purpose, the mission that these vehicles were going to serve and meet, there were different types of requirements for the type of tires that were needed.   Vivake Asnani: Yeah, the -- MET was really interesting; it was basically a wheelbarrow that the astronauts used to tow around equipment. If you look back at all the Apollo missions, each mission they tried to get, you know, produce more equipment to carry more rocks. And so, the MET carried a bunch of tools for geology and carried rocks. There was an emergency memo that went to Goodyear that said, “we need a tire, we need a tire for this, you know, instrument carrying machine.” And so, they did what they knew, they produced a pneumatic tire, super interesting though, because it's going to the Moon, there's not atmosphere. They put this tire in a vacuum chamber on Earth and in the vacuum chamber, they introduced just a few air molecules, which allowed it to open up to the right size that it would be on the Moon. Then, took it out of the vacuum chamber, and it got crushed under Earth gravity, and they put it into the spacecraft. And when they landed on the Moon, and experienced that vacuum atmosphere again, it expanded to the correct size. So, it was a really interesting trick they played to get a tire on this wheelbarrow on the Moon.  Host: So --  Vivake Asnani: Yeah.  Host: -- you went through a couple -- Vivake, you went through this -- you went through the Russian, is it Lunokhod, am I saying that right?  Vivake Asnani: Lunokhod.  Host: Lunokhod, OK. So, you said that was a rigid tire, and then, you're -- the one you're just talking about, the Goodyear tire, this is a pneumatic tire. So, can you describe those a little bit, just for, you know, for -- well, this is -- -- unfortunately, this is not like a visual medium, right, so, I'm like trying to imagine it. When I hear rigid, I just think of like, this like -- you know, basically a wheel of steel maybe. And then, Goodyear, I think about -- I don't know, like one of those -- you know the old cars like 1950s cars that like, they're just kind of like a flat tube around the car. Am I imagining this right?  Vivake Asnani: You are, yeah.  Host: OK, good.  Vivake Asnani: Because the Russian Lunokhad vehicle had -- it had eight rigid wheels. Each of them looked like a bicycle wheel with spokes and on the perimeter was this rigid mesh structure. So, just a screen type of construct. Really basic -- it was really intended just to be light in weight and roll. And the Goodyear tire, you're right, it was just like an old timey smooth tire. It wasn't there for traction; it was there to be pulled. And so, it just could be smooth without any tread -- and the main thing is, they wanted it to be light in weight, so, you know, with everything we launch we just go for low mass. So, it wasn't until the next vehicle, the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle, that carried astronauts, that traction became a really big deal. Traction, and they wanted to travel fast. So, the trick to traveling fast on the Moon where there's really low gravity and the vehicle doesn't weigh much, when you hit those rocks, you want to absorb them, you don't want a hard impact, because literally, it will send all four wheels off the surface and you'll lose control of the vehicle. That's what drove the innovation. So, if you want to hear more about the tires that were produced for the Lunar Roving Vehicle, that's very interesting.  Host: Yeah, so, that's -- OK, so, they have to -- I'm trying to paint the picture in my head. So, are they really digging into the regolith, and just kind of pushing it a little bit more so, than just kind of scrapping off the top, maybe like a Goodyear tire would, as the -- am I getting that right?  Vivake Asnani: The big difference was the Lunar Roving Vehicle tires needed to wrap themselves around obstacles at high speed.  Host: Oh, OK.  Vivake Asnani: And so, this led to like an innovation of making a tire out of wire that could reorganize every time it hit an obstacle and that quality is called an envelopment. And instead of the obstacle creating an impact for the vehicle, the tire absorbs it, and then you can continue driving with, you know, contact in the surface. So, that was an invention that started at Goodyear, actually, they made the earliest versions. And then, as it became more of a like a spaceflight piece of hardware -- the General Motors Defense Resource Laboratory, they further developed that. They wove it like a shirt out of what's basically guitar strings. So, if you play a guitar like the -- E -- the A string is about the same thickness as the wire they used. And they wove it like a shirt and shaped it into a tire and then tuned it to behave kind of like a tire does on Earth. So, it was kind of a mix between engineering and art. It's something worth googling, it's a beautiful tire.  Host: Very interesting, now -- Yajaira, I'm thinking about the materials used on these -- Martian rovers, when you're -- are we just, you know, are we using guitar string metal? Like -- what are the materials consideration when you start designing a lunar rover?   Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: So, one of the considerations, right, as I mentioned previously is, what type of application, what type of functionality we would like to see in these tires? What type of vehicle -- we -- these tires are needed for? So, for instance, the Russian Lunokhod tire allowed that vehicle to travel long distances. I -- learned that the travel distances exceeding ten kilometers, so comparing to the distances traveled by Mars rovers, these Lunar Rovers -- cover, covered greater distances. The Lunar Roving Vehicle for instance, could sustain maximum speed of 16 kilometers per hour. It was a 4 by 4-wheel vehicle. And in terms of materials -- do you have more insight about the different types of materials that were used for these tires?  Vivake Asnani: Are you asking about Lunokhod or the Lunar Roving Vehicle?   Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, -- both, like -- Lunar -- what are the differences between Lunar Roving Vehicle and Russian Lunokhod tires?   Vivake Asnani: I don't know. You know, we didn't have a ton of insight into the Soviet design for Lunokhod. It seemed to be some sort of steel, and the materials that were used on the wire tires for the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle were essentially music wire.  Host: Oh, interesting -- very --  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, now, that's interesting, yeah, that's real interesting --  Host: Yeah, I was making a joke about the guitar string, but it sounds like, yeah, it sounded like that's what it was. That's very, very interesting.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah, that's what it was.  Host: How about that. All right, now, sort of leading into Mars, right, because I think that's part of the, part of what we're going to be talking about today is -- the innovations you guys have been working on. I want to explore a little bit of history of the tires that have been on Mars, so -- some of the -- there's, you know, been -- rovers, you know, no humans yet, but rovers on the surface of -- Mars -- that have driven. So, anything you can share about those technologies.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: So, we all know that in terms of wheels on Mars, all the rover wheels are rigid wheels. For instance, Curiosity wheels are made of aluminum. And -- but we have seen each of, you know, with those Curiosity wheels on Mars -- engineers were -- surprised by the magnitude of damage -- that they saw in these wheels. And Mars is hard. Mars is hard, as we can share with you today, it's -- the type of embedded pointy rocks, bedrock that were encountered in that traverse path by Curiosity really have an impact in these type of wheels. But, in general, we know as a matter of fact, you know -- the tires, the wheels that we have sent to Mars are rigid. So, that has driven some of these -- innovation and focus work on trying to look at better wheels and tire designs that, to address some of the challenges associated with struggles in very difficult terrain on Mars.  Host: Yeah, I think I've seen those pictures, right. So, Curiosity did, you know, awesome things when it -- just after it landed, we got to see some super high-resolution photos of the rover, right. It traveled across the Martian surface doing a bunch of science, and sometimes it took some selfies. And over time, I think we started to see, right, some of those tires. it was taking selfies of the tires. And we could see holes in them, right. So, that's what you're talking about, rigid tires, it's made out of that aluminum, but those sharp -- those sharp rocks are -- doing some damage to the rigid tires.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, that's correct.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: I mean, you can imagine, right, the impact that it will have -- in mission operations, in how, you know, these traverse paths will need to be carefully, you know, planned. In order to extend the life of these rigid wheels, and therefore, you know, extend the life of -- the Curiosity rover to meet its mission objective.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah, and Curiosity, I mean, it's just an awesome rover. And it's -- as an engineer you look at it, you're -- you get a pit in your stomach when you see something going wrong like that.  Host: Yeah.  Vivake Asnani: We -- You know, JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) -- they took a hard look at the reasons for this, right, the -- there's -- as Yajaira said, embedded rocks that are very sharp, they're not going to move -- when you encounter them. And if you have a six-wheel rover, and a heavy one like Curiosity, something like 850 kilograms or perhaps more -- when one wheel encounters one of those embedded rocks, the other five try to drive it through. So, it's, you know, five wheels ganging up on one, it doesn't have a choice, and it gets punctured by this embedded rock. It's not something that was seen in, on Earth for testing. And so, anymore, our risk posture for testing is quite careful -- we test almost everything.  Host: So, let's dive into that Vivake, thinking about why Mars is hard, right. So, you talked about, you know, when you're talking about JPL rovers exploring the surface of Mars, one of those reasons that Mars is hard is because of these rocks. You know, when you think about driving on another planet, I think that's the one that may be most obvious when it comes to tires, right, is that puncture, right. You don't want to puncture the tire, so, these rocks are one of those things that makes Mars so difficult.  Vivake Asnani: Rocks are one of those things. And you know, Mars is surprisingly rocky, and when you get into the dry lake beds like, you know, Gale Crater where Curiosity -- went -- and you get to Jezero where Perseverance is right now, you can just look around and see all these embedded -- cemented in rocks -- would make sense, right, it was in an ancient lake bed. And -- that, that's -- a massive challenge if you're trying to fight against those rocks, and what tires that are flexible to do -- is to stop the fight, to accommodate and conform to the surface so, that there's not as much stress, and there's no puncture. Mars is hard for other reasons too. If you look just about anywhere, any region you can see ripples. And this is essentially the wind picking up certain particle sizes, really small, and blowing them into sort of a rippley pattern that your tires encounter. And if you get all four or all six, depending on your vehicle, tires on these ripples, you can sit there and spin in place. We saw that with the MER (Mars Exploration Rovers) rovers, both Spirit and Opportunity. And -- you know, tires help with this as well, flexible tires they spread out the footprint and keep you on top of the surface, you dig in less. But, you know, bringing something flexible to a planet like Mars is hard, because it gets cold, it gets really cold at night, like minus 130 degrees Celsius -- in Fahrenheit it's about minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit and your material needs to stay flexible. So, I mean, that's the primary engineering challenge on the material level. Yajaira being a material scientist could probably explain that challenge.  Host: Yeah, Yajaira, it sounds like something that -- when you're thinking about a tire, right, what's going to work on this surface? Something that is going to easily deal with these punctures, right, possible punctures, the rocks that are in place. Something that has enough grip, so you don't get stuck like -- Vivake was saying, and something that can deal with extreme temperatures on another planet.   Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yes, that's correct, and that's where our team, the Mars Spring Tire team has been focusing on for many years on understanding that interplay between the microscopic, you know, properties of a tire. You know, what type of spring geometry, and how we -- weave those springs to make a tire. How that has -- or relates to -- materials properties, to the properties of those materials that made up those springs? So, we are talking about, you know, like how we can trim the compliance, flexibility of this tire -- by design, by spring geometry selections, as well as materials, the material of choice, you know, here. So, in GRC (Glenn Research Center) Vivake mentioned earlier, a lot of their work related or focus on flexible tires and compliant tires made use of steel, steel a conventional metal, was a metal that can be irreversibly deformed. So, after that metal is deformed over and over -- several cycles it can be irreversible, irreversibly deformed. And that's where, you know, these materials innovations come to play, where GRC material scientists, along with tire engineers were able to identify materials such as, shape memory alloy materials, materials that have super elastic properties, and we can discuss what that means. And materials that can -- withstand the very extreme temperature conditions that we find on Mars, and keep that material -- with, you know, reversible, meaning a material that can undergo reversible reformation within that wide range of temperatures on Mars. A material that will remember, will have a memory and will remember its original shape. So, it's -- that combination of materials, use of shape memory alloys to make and manufacture these springs that we use to then build the tire. And the macro, you know, level design of that tire, which makes these Mars Spring -- tires -- suitable, you know, solution for -- these upcoming Mars Sample Return missions, and -- upcoming and future rover missions.  Host: Interesting. So, when you're describing that material design, you use the terms reversible and irreversible, right, you have something I guess that forms to the shape of whatever you're driving on, but doesn't snap back to its original form, the shape that I guess it's supposed to maintain. It makes me think of a memory foam mattress, right. You get on and it makes that imprint of yourself, right --  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah.  Host: -- and then you get up, and then, boom, it slowly just snaps back to that nice flatbed that you're wanting. That's what I'm imagining, but I guess in a tire form, is this -- am I on the right track here?   Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yes, you are, you are. And what we are talking here is -- on the materials level, right.  Host: OK. OK.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: What we -- when we talk about reversible deformation, let's imagine that material at that, at the atomic scale. So, pretty much a shape-memory alloy is a material that when it’s -- when stress applied to the material, what we see is how these atoms, you know, rearrange in such a way that the material itself can -- can withstand very large strain. But that material and those -- you know, atomic bonds reverse to its original you know, shape or structure or crystalline structure at the atomic level. So, these are processes that are happening at the atomic level, and that's why I get very excited as a material chemist as you can imagine for the uses and application of these type of Mars materials. A material that is stimuli responsive, and the public may be more familiar with the use of shape-memory alloys as actuators. Let's say shape-memory alloys that can move parts in systems, mechanical parts in systems by adding certain types of stimuli, specializing on electrically, an electrical stimuli or heat, for example. But in our case, the shape-memory alloy application that we are developing for these Mars missions is a type of shape-memory alloy that doesn't require the several electrical activation or heat activation, it's a material that has been defined chemically and processed in a way that we can just leverage the ability of the material to withstand very large, you know, like deformations of the material without irreversibly deforming or breaking the material. The material doesn't break, we can continue deforming the material reversibly over, you know, certain – light and length of time, and the material will -- remember that original shape or atomic structure that it has.  Host: I see. OK, so I'm imaging a tire going over one, like a big pointy rock almost like a pyramid, right. So, what I'm, what I imagine when it comes to this shape-memory alloy is the tire rolls over that pyramid, takes the shape of the pyramid, and as it rolls off the pyramid, it goes back to its original shape, that's the idea here.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: That's correct, that’s correct. And that good result or good outcome -- comes from the design of these Spring tires along with tuning the material's properties at the chemical atomic level, so that even at the atomic level, that material can, yes, can go back to that original structure or shape.  Host: So, diving into this, right, we're, now we're getting into the Spring Tire itself, tell me about, a little bit of the history, was the Spring Tire -- did it come up -- because of these problems that you were trying to solve with driving on the Martian surface? Maybe shape-memory alloys came up first? Give us a little bit of background on this project.  Vivake Asnani: Sure. Yeah, so this came up very early in my career. I mentioned we started thinking about how to drive on the Moon and we saw that it had been done before, right. So, the first thing that we did was try to find the original engineers, the people who developed the Moon Tire, the wire mesh Moon Tire. And -- you know -- we'd found several experts that helped us by giving us documentation, but then we hit the jackpot. We found the actual lead rover designer named Ferenc Pavlics. He worked at General Motors Defense Research Laboratory. So, we got a chance to meet him in Santa Barbara. And at first it was kind of like, what we found, what we received from others. We had PowerPoint slides, and we were looking at their story and things they built. And then they did this big reveal where they came into the room and showed us one of the original tires.  Host: Get out. [Laughter]  Vivake Asnani: And -- yeah, we were like, OK -- you could have led with that.  Host: Right? [Laughter]  Vivake Asnani: So -- I think it probably was one slated for Apollo 18 that never flew.  Host: OK.  Vivake Asnani: And they explained to us that, you know, living through that time, there was a conflict between funding the Apollo program and the cost of the Vietnam War. So, the, you know, the congress of that time they -- abruptly shut down Apollo, a lot of the hardware for Apollo 18 existed but wasn't used. So, they put one of these tires in their closet and kept it there until we came knocking on the door. So, you know, engineers from Johnson Space Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory and myself, we were just, you know, tripping over ourselves to learn about this. Eventually, we decided to bring this to the experts, so we took this hardware to Goodyear, which is close to where we -- do our engineering in Cleveland at the Glenn Research Center, Goodyear is the neighboring city in Akron. And we set up an agreement that we're going to -- you know, we're all going to get together and try to learn what this is -- reverse engineer it, remanufacture it and get all the value of it out of this original invention. So, we set up shop in the Goodyear Blimp hangar, and made essentially a manufacturing shop. We built all of the machines that were needed to remake this tire. And in the end, we started to understand it. We made it, tested it, understood its limitations and then we wanted to see, can we use it for the next Moon Missions, which were much heavier vehicles. So, we started trying to make heavier versions of this, so we increased the wire thickness and such. And we found out that the structure locks up, it's no longer flexible when you try to make it support heavier loads. So, at that point we were stuck, and we went back to the agency, we went back to NASA Headquarters and we said -- \"We need to make a change.\" And so, we kicked off this program called Generalizing Moon Tire Technology. It had the goal to try to make it a useful technology for the heavier Moon vehicles and for Earth vehicles and Earth gravity. And so, you know, that was a really, really fun/frustrating thing to work on, because we tried all kinds of design changes. And just hit walls, we couldn't figure out how to make something as good as the Earth tire, which has air and rubber, but without those ingredients, we'd just be working with the wire. We tried making tries that looked like slinkies, we tried changing the tire to look like Earth tires, we had like radial construction. In the end, we stumbled upon the Spring Tire. We were trying to make these wire tires, and we're having trouble keeping the wire in place. So, we were using springs as spacers to keep the wires separated from one another. And over time we kept adding springs and removing wires, and eventually the whole thing was just a Spring Tire. And we created that Spring Tire sort of like a fireplace spring if you can imagine. Where, each spring is intercoiled with its neighbor, kind of like DNA, and then shaped into the structure of a tire. So, it was kind of an accident, we can't say we had a really clear design logic, but in the end made for a really useful tire.  Host: Yeah, you know, it's almost like, it sounds like a trial and error journey, right. Let's try this, no, that didn't work. Let's try this, no, that didn't work. And then it seems like springs were sort of leading you in the right direction. At what point did shape-memory alloys come into the story?  Vivake Asnani: Later on. Actually, I want to, if you don't mind, I want to give a quick shoutout to Jim Benzing who --  Host: Yeah.  Vivake Asnani: -- I think put us on. He was a Goodyear engineer who put us on the right path, because -- we tried a lot of, I would say academic solutions, and he was like, \"OK, guys, let's get in there and try stuff,\" and that's how we got -- we arrived at a design solution. Shade-memory alloys came many years later when we shifted our attention from the Moon to Mars. And you know, the initial step was to try the original Spring Tire on a Mars, what we call a life test. And essentially, that's driving, in this case, it was like a half of the Mars 2020, or the Perseverance rover around a test track and just seeing if your tires will survive. Well, the original Spring Tires survived, but it would get dented, it would get plastically deformed, and that just created the problem to solve and the material innovation was what was brought in, the shape-memory alloys in order to solve that problem.  Host: I see, and that's where Yajaira comes into the mix, right. Yajaira, so how did that, how did you start incorporating this shape-memory alloy with the Spring Tire design?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Well, I should -- say that in our team, that to add to that story, right.  Host: Yeah.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: So, we have in our Mars Spring Tire Team, we have material scientists, we have tire engineers and back in the days when as Vivake said, when these steel tires started giving issues associated with plastic deformation, it was a moment of serendipity between Dr. Santo Padula and Colin Creager, Engineer Colin Creager, where they started chatting about, you know how to fix that problem. And Dr. Santo Padula, like our SMA expert, subject matter expert in our project, he offered the use of SMA tires as a solution. And since then -- the, that moment, you know, that moment between that, that, is what started, you know, the, this new engineering development, you know, incorporating these shape-memory alloys as the material of choice for -- for these tires.  Host: So, Vivake, taking this concept, right, the Spring Tires as we know it today, tell me about some the testing that you guys have been doing to prepare this tire for its next step on another, on the surface of another planet.  Vivake Asnani: Sure. Yeah, so, you can kind of put testing in two categories, performance and survival. So, we obviously, we focused on survival as sort of the primary thing. We -- the same engineer who was coinventor with myself on the Spring Tire, Jim Benzing -- we hired him after he retired from Goodyear. And he's a career machine designer, he's building our life test. And if you can picture this, this is a chamber that holds Mars's temperature and a carousel of Mars' terrain revolves within that chamber, really harsh rocks. We spied on Mars so to speak, we used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's, high-rise stereo imaging tool to look at the surface where we're going, see the terrain that we might encounter in this next mission, and construct the life test to represent that terrain. So, we have the right rocks -- and we're in the right temperature environment and to account for the gravity difference, we have an interesting mechanism within this chamber that, you know, balances like a seesaw the right amount of -- rover mass but also allows you to have that light weight that you would have on Mars. And we drive to four times the mission life to understand if we can survive and have, you know, reserve life, just to be sure. So, that's the survival side of things. And on the traction side of things, we have a whole laboratory, we call it the Slope Lab. We actually developed it for the Constellation Program, but if you can picture that, inside is this adjustable tilt bed, which -- it's essentially two dump truck beds welded together, and we can angle it with the hydraulics up to like 40-something degrees. So, we can use that to evaluate slope traversal and we have another big sandbox and other machines that allow us to drive and evaluate different rover operations. So, you know, we are doing our best to try and cover our basis and go in with our eyes wide open.  Host: I'm trying to get a, paint a picture on that first test that you were talking about, Vivake. Is -- I'm -- I imagine like some chamber, right that's simulating the Martian surface, and you said drive to four times the design life. So, how I imagine it is a tire just kind of going around like a carousel -- for -- I don't know, in my mind, I think years. Is that what's going on here, you're just kind of driving this thing over and over, and over?  Vivake Asnani: You know, fortunately, it doesn't take that long.  Host: OK.  Vivake Asnani: We can get ourselves a full life test under our belt in about a week.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Vivake Asnani: What's -- yeah -- it's not too bad. You know, if you compare that to driving on Mars, there's a lot of downtime, you're not driving at night, it's too cold. You're -- with this particular rover it's solar powered, so your energy limited as far as how you go each day. But, you know, it's also autonomous, so, it's not like the Apollo rovers where you could drive quite fast and quite far. It's going to set the land speed record on Mars, but still quite slow. So, when you test on Earth we go faster and because we're going continuously, we can get the whole mission done in a couple days, and, you know, get ourselves an even longer test in a week. Basically, we keep the wheel and the tire attached to an, one arm of what would be the rover. And the carousel moves while the tire rotates.  Host: Aha.  Vivake Asnani: So, we're not driving around, it's kind of fixed, and that's what lets us be inside of a temperature chamber by keeping everything stationary and having the carousel move underneath the tire.  Host: OK, I get it now, yeah. And -- I, that totally makes sense, right, because the -- even the rovers they're driving now, they drive a little bit, they pause for a long time, and then they drive a little big again, you know. So, it's, I -- see, you're just basically getting that, all of that time done, the driving part done in a week. So, I -- understand that.  Vivake Asnani: Yeah.  Host: OK. So, what's next for the Spring Tire? You keep talking about missions, you know, getting ready for the missions. So -- what are you -- what are you preparing for? What's the -- Mars tire going to, or the Spring Tire going to do?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yes, excellent. So, the Mars Spring Tire is the subsystem that will be delivered to ESA -- Sample Fetch Rover. So, have been very excited, right, about the successful landing of Perseverance. Now Perseverance Rover is on Mars, will be collecting samples, putting -- Martian soil samples in -- in this tube that a future Mars Sample Return mission will be collecting to return them back to Earth. So, we are part of that endeavor. We have been collaborating with ESA -- in their -- with their Sample Fetch Rover design, and -- right now, with our part or role it's to design and build the wheel and tire assemblies that will be integrated in these -- in the Fetch Rover. And, I should mention that earlier in the conversation you were wondering about the time, you know, that these future rovers will have to traverse the Mars terrain.  Host: Mm-hmm.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: And we should say that for the Mars Sample Return mission and in contrast to Perseverance, which is a scientific missions, right, these sample Fetch Rover won't have a lot of time, so that's why new rover -- development, new tire developments are needed to ensure, as we have mentioned, to ensure that these -- 4 by 4 Sample Fetch Rover -- Rovers will have sufficient traction, that these wheel and tire assemblies will be durable enough, that will -- that these wheel and tire assemblies -- will help this rover to save energy, so that the rover travels more terrain, and go and catch the samples. And the tube that the Perseverance will be -- leaving in -- default and specified locations -- to then, you know, return them to -- the Mars Ascend Vehicle that will bring them, you know, back to Earth. So, the, lots of work with design, lots of work, you know, co-engineering efforts to define those --wheel and tire assembly requirements. And Vivake -- you can add more to that.  Vivake Asnani: Oh, I'd love to. This is one of my favorite subjects. So, the next mission -- the next mission to Mars as Yajaira just said is retrieval mission, so it's called Sample Retrieval Lander. It's really unusual in two ways -- number one is, we're taking a rover and a rocket in the same lander, they have to coexist. So, usually, we talk a lot about mass, mass is a big deal when you engineer a space craft. Here, we're also really volume constrained, so the rover folds up, and it has -- there's a neat little compartment inside the back-shell interface structure where it lives. And it doesn't have the ability to be as big as Curiosity, right, or you know, the Perseverance Rover -- it's much smaller -- but it still needs enough traction to get through the region where the big rover currently is in Jezero Crater. So, the tires were enabling -- the tires allow the baby rover to have enough traction to keep up with the big rover. And so, in that sense tires are really important to this mission. And the other thing that Yajaira touched on is it's time constrained -- it's a solar rover that's doing the pickup. And -- the solar rover can't be around for any kind of global dust events that might occur up on Mars. So, those tend to happen in the fall, wintertime, so we're trying to constrain the mission to spring and summer, which means you have to get your mission done in two seasons. And to make that happen, you really want to go as far as you can every day. And the thing I mentioned earlier is, tires save energy, and energy lets you go an additional distance. So, in two ways, you know, having these tires is enabling for us to pick up samples from the surface of Mars.  Host: See, this is so fascinating, there's a lot of application here, Vivake. As you're talking about this upcoming mission, right, some of the things that are going through my head is, you know, there's a lot of application here, there's a lot of, there's been a lot of testing for this. Is this scalable, right. So, we're talking about returning humans to the Moon in the very near future. That means a -- not necessarily a continuous presence, but a sustained presence of humans on the Moon. And what I'm thinking is maybe humans can benefit from a technology scaled up to a lunar rover that's, that -- uses a lot of this technology. Is there a future for scaling up the -- Spring Tire Technology? I know you're talking about Mars, right, for a lot of this, but is there a potential for it to be -- on use on the Moon?  Vivake Asnani: I do think so. The Spring Tire was originally developed for the Moon. I can say with the materials we have today, it could support an equatorial mission. So, you know, it's not going to get as cold as if you were to say, go to -- a crater -- at one of the poles, which is hidden from the sun, and gets -- you know, colder than our current material can tolerate. So, today, you know, the Spring Tire is scalable for you know, larger vehicles with heavier loads. And it's really great at keeping a rover on the ground when you drive fast on the Moon, and that's what you want. If you're going to bring people to the Moon, you want to efficiently move them around. And so, a fast-moving rover on the Moon would really benefit from a set of spring tires. We have more work to do if we're going to go to the poles. We need to do further material innovation to start getting down to polar temperatures.  Host: Now, Yajaira, you talked -- you know, Vivake just mentioned material innovation, right. There was a shape-memory alloy that went into the Spring Tire design, and a lot of innovation to make that possible for the upcoming Mars mission. But I wonder -- you know, there seems like there was a lot of work in here, and there's a lot of benefits of shape-memory alloys, potentially of Spring Tires. Is there anything that can be brought back down to Earth for the benefit of us here on, that are stuck on this planet?  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Yeah, excellent, excellent question. So, yes, the answer is yes. Shape-memory alloys -- have been around for decades, have been around for decades. And some predict that their demand will reach the $20 billion dollars by 2025. So, there are lots of earth-bound applications of shade-memory alloys that are -- currently in place, and that will be further expanded and developed. In the area of biomedical devices, for instance, we know shade-memory alloys are currently used as the material for a stent -- the stents. Another applications, you know, would be for engines, or you know, anything that -- makes a mover, right. Or a shade-memory alloy as an actuator to move parts. So, those are -- applications that are currently in place. What I can tell you, there has been so much interest from the industry and private sector on these GRCs, shade-memory alloy development. So, currently there is a company that commercializing shade-memory alloy Spring Tires for -- bikes, for -- bicycle applications. And we also see it, I mean, we also see potential for, you know, medium fit of the rove tires, for vehicles for military, for any type of application that, where you want to remove and avoid that single point of failure, right, of a flat tire. So, really exciting times, really good to see how our engineers, our scientists, you know, they -- are now -- at this point, they are enjoying, right, the, all the -- good outcome and fruit of all these years of effort. Seeing these companies now, you know, looking for applications. The list is quite interesting, because when we look back at the history of tires, and the history of rover made tires, everything started to, with, you know, like the design of a rover tire for bicycles. And now we are seeing like kind of the same thing but, of course, I mean, the applications go beyond these type of you know, bicycles and – vehicles, we see potential in many other areas as well.  Host: Wow. Yajaira and Vivake, what a fascinating conversation that we just had today. Tires on different planets, and just wonderful stories that you were able to share throughout that whole process. This has been a really, really good conversation. So, to both of you, I appreciate you going over the Spring Tire and the history of tires when it comes to driving on different planetary bodies. And I thank you both for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today, it was a pleasure.  Vivake Asnani: Thank you so much, it was great.  Yajaira Sierra-Sastre: Thank you so much.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking round. I hope you enjoyed our conversation today with Yajaira and Vivake as much as I did, I definitely learned a lot about tires, not only the history, but a lot of the cool technology that's under work right now for missions to Mars, and perhaps the Moon.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 193, “Expanding the Market in Low-Earth Orbit.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. Today we're going to take you inside another important aspect of the mission of the International Space Station. From before the first element of the station was launched in 1998 through the arrival of Expedition 1 to begin a continuous human habitation of space that's now in its 21st year, one of the International Space Station program’s primary goals has been to promote the commercialization of space: by creating a science laboratory in orbit, and by being a reliable destination for years and years, and yes, by providing seed money for private development. The station has provided a goal that private companies could drive toward, whether in making use of the facility for scientific research, or in delivering payloads, or in creating their own products--heck, creating their own companies--to help move private enterprise off of planet Earth. And it's worked. This is the fourth in a series of NASA-sponsored panel discussions in recognition of the 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the station. We brought you the first ones in February, March and early April. This time, representatives of NASA and several private companies discuss how the station has helped create a new era in space exploration. The moderator is NASA public affairs officer Gary Jordan, who you've heard here on the podcast from time to time. He will introduce you to eight guests gathered at a virtual roundtable to provide some background and perspective about the development of commercial space and their thoughts about the next steps. OK then, here we go.  [ Music]  Gary Jordan: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this next installment in our series of panels in celebration of the 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. The station has been a critical test bed for scientific research and technology development in low-Earth orbit for the past two decades. By the time we reached 20 years of continuous human habitation, more than 3,000 experiments had been conducted involving 4,200 researchers from 108 countries. Truly an international orbiting laboratory. What is clear is that there is value in low-Earth orbit in the future of operations in low-Earth orbit lies with commercial companies. Commercial work done in low-Earth orbit is not new. NASA has had long standing relationships with commercial companies; in fact, many of our panelists today represent those very companies. The International Space Station will play a critical role in NASA's goal to develop a robust economy of robust commercial economy in low-Earth orbit. So, on today's panel titled “Expanding the Market in Low-Earth Orbit” we're going to explore the history and future of the commercialization of low-Earth orbit with some of the most influential people leading these efforts. So, joining our esteemed panel today is Mike Read, International Space Station business and economic development manager at NASA; John Mulholland, vice president and manager for the International Space Station program at Boeing; Christine Kretz, vice president of programs and partnerships for the International Space Station, U.S. National Lab; Jeffrey Manber, chief executive officer and co-founder at Nanoracks; Rich Boling, vice president of corporate advancement at Techshot; Phil McAlister, director of commercial spaceflight at NASA; Benji Reed, senior director of human spaceflight at SpaceX; and Ven Feng, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Thank you all for taking the time to discuss this topic today. Mike Read, I want to start with you. Sort of setting the context for what we're going to be talking about today. We talked about low-Earth orbit in my introduction, said that phrase quite a bit. But let's start with that. What is low-Earth orbit? And what is special about that part of space for commercialization efforts?  Mike Read: Low-Earth orbit, that's what's close to Earth. The closest to the Earth as opposed to geostationary, which is 22,000 miles away. This could be as close as 150 or 200 miles away. And that's the orbit that space station’s in, about 250 miles. It's quick to get to. It's cheaper, relatively to get to than your deeper space orbits. And so, that's -- a platform that -- where we have a space station where we do most of our research right now. It's also very expensive to get platforms into a much deeper space positioning. And so therefore, access to it is more expensive and the volume is incredibly limited.  Gary Jordan: So, Mike, let's talk about the International Space Station in particular. How is the International Space Station a player in some of these commercialization efforts? And then why is this commercialization effort, at all, important to NASA?  Mike Read: I'm going to start with the second question first, because the why you do something seems to me always to set the stage for the how. That -- there's a couple of truisms with regard to NASA and our need for space. One is NASA is always going to have a need for a low-Earth orbit platform, for crew proficiency and training, for our fundamental and applied research and critically for our advanced systems development, for our exploration program. Because things don't operate in space the same way they do in 1 g. And until we've got years of operating in a low-Earth orbit platform with a next-gen system, we're not going to put that in a deep space platform and trust it. But the second thing is space station is going to be the last U.S. government-funded, and 100%-led platform in LEO. It's just -- it's not tenable. It's not going to -- there will not be another U.S, government LEO platform. And so, if we don't use station right now to enable the development of not only the next generation platform, but the use of that platform, the supply side is critical for our LEO economy. You were working on our crew and cargo transportation, that's been going on for well over a decade and others on this panel are going to discuss those. And more recently, we've also enabled the development of a commercially-led element that will attach as a new module to ISS, that can be used for research and government as a customer, but not the customer. But that's only one-half of the equation. An economy is built of the supply side and, and the demand side. And right now, the U.S. government is virtually the only user of significance of the platform when we pay virtually all of the costs. And that's simply not -- not tenable going forward. We have to help enable other users of the LEO platform to see that they can actually do it and the national lab folks are going to talk about that, because they're bringing in not only non-NASA players, but non-government players and that's critical. About two or three years ago, we kind of stopped to assess what we'd been doing over the last decade or more, and what we were seeing was there weren't a lot of return customers. And I use that term loosely. There were a lot of companies, commercial companies that were doing research, but it wasn't a key element of their commercial research plan. And so, we said, what -- why is that? And it's because it -- first of all they don't understand microgravity. Secondly, it's expensive to adapt your terrestrial research to operate in a microgravity environment. So, we started a very focused project to enable scalable, sustainable demand, non-NASA demand for a next-generation platform, using the space station while we have it. And so, space station program started investing in a portfolio of in-space manufacturing projects. Anything from retinal implants to bio-printing, to optical fibers, exotic fibers, silicon carbide. Things like that if successful, if you can prove that they’re orders of magnitude better than what you can do in 1 g, you can afford the cost of using space and all of the things that drive the cost for doing that. So, that portfolio is migrating to a new LEO commercialization office that the agency has stood up. The agency actually adopted a very broad LEO commercialization strategy over a year ago. And so, the bits and pieces that the ISS program had been working on for years have now coalesced into a cohesive strategy. And that’s pretty cool.  Gary Jordan: And I think what's also cool, Mike is that it's really -- we're talking about some of these recent efforts. There's even a deeper history here. In fact, the International Space Station and NASA really, have always had relationships with commercial companies. John Mulholland, I'm going to pass it over to you. Boeing, in particular, has had an extensive history working with NASA. Notably, the company's work on the shuttle and the International Space Station. Can you describe the relationship between NASA and Boeing, specifically for the International Space Station?  John Mulholland: Yeah, I mean I really think from a human spaceflight perspective, we've grown up with NASA. We've been NASA's partner on every U.S. human spaceflight mission dating all the way back to Mercury. On ISS in particular, we've been NASA's primary partner since 1986 when the ISS was still known as Freedom. Working with NASA we designed and built most of the U.S. segments. We integrated the international partners; we've been NASA's primary partner throughout. Today, the focus is on sustainment operations. Make sure operations are -- safely performed. And then, really importantly, looking you know, now and into the future, capability restoration and enhancement that's really going to set the stage to do research on ISS over the next decade or more. And then payload integration. And payload integration is just hugely important because that returns the investment on the ISS. And as you mentioned, there's been over 3,000 experiments done to date. Fantastic laboratory, and we're just proud to have been NASA's partner throughout.  Gary Jordan: And -- that partnership really has been -- is a continuing thing, right? What have you seen, John, in terms of the value, just working on the International Space Station program with NASA from Boeing for so long, what is the value that you have really seen with the International Space Station?  John Mulholland: Yeah, I think, you know, there's -- lots of streams of value. You know, one is the international collaboration and everything there. But really, what I think the legacy of the ISS is going to be is the research and discovery that's -- that we've had to date, and that we promise to show in the future. And just a couple of examples of research that's almost getting ready to be fielded in a cure for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, that was fundamentally developed because of research on the ISS. And just, you know, in the last month or so, scientists completed research on a potential cure for leukemia. So, you know, between those, manufacturing in space, there's just so much promise. Everything that we have done as a species, all the discoveries we’ve made, have been made under the influence of gravity. This is the first time that a national laboratory has been dedicated to research without the effects of gravity. And we're seeing astounding results.  Gary Jordan: So, let's explore that a little bit. The idea of the space station as a U.S. National Lab. Christine Kretz, at the top of this panel I mentioned more than 3,000 experiments have been conducted on the station. Thousands of researchers, more than a hundred different countries. Many of these experiments were conducted and performed were through the function of the International Space Station as a U.S. National Lab. Can you explain what that means and why it's important?  Christine Kretz: Sure, that's great, Gary, and thanks for the question. As you know, Congress opened up the National Lab as a way for researchers around the world, but U.S. researchers especially, to have access for non-NASA research. And Mike pointed out some of the things that NASA has helped foster. But opening it up to a broader group of researchers on Earth to think about how they may take that terrific asset that we have in space, and leverage it for their research was important. That spans academics, universities, startup companies. Mike mentioned the optical implant that is coming out of LambdaVision, from a startup organization, as well as working with industry partners, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi recently. And then others like Adidas. So, having companies have access to the space station required something that was a kind of a non, non-NASA opportunity. That gives us 50% of the upmass and downmass plus 50% of the astronaut time. And with more astronauts onboard the station right now, that's more astronaut time that we're happy to have access to. It's a lot of partnerships. And so, the partnerships that John mentioned are important. Partnership with NASA to foster that with us and help us collaborate together; partnerships with companies like Boeing that have sponsored the technology and space prize that created the opportunity for LambdaVision to put their application into space, partnerships with NSF (National Science Foundation) and NIH (National Institutes of Health), who also foster research like tissue chips in space that we work with;  and then the commercial service providers, and Rich and Jeff are here today to talk about their efforts, they provide access directly through their operations to go to the space station, including STEM, other kinds of really interesting regenerative medicine research that’s going on. And a partner can go directly to their organizations and those commercial service providers access the space station through our allocation. It's important just for the same things that Mike and John mentioned previously, which is really innovative efforts that would not be possible without the access granted by Congress in partnership with NASA to access that. So, some of the things mentioned here were muscular dystrophy, leukemia research, the regenerative medicine work that's going on that may someday cause, allow us to have implantable organs. I mean it's -- it sounds far-fetched, but the direction to use this is really an amazing innovative platform. And because of the access that these researchers have, I guess it's, it’s corny to say the sky is the limit but in fact, it's amazing to see what people come up with and we’re really excited to continue to work with NASA and our partners here to allow that access.  Gary Jordan: Christine you've given so many fantastic examples of some of the research on station. And you mentioned opening it up as a U.S. lab in 2005 or at least the -- push from Congress to do so. Have you seen an increase in participation in demand from when you first started opening it up as U.S. lab, trying to get the word out that there is this orbiting laboratory that companies have access to, have you seen an increase to where we are now in 2020?  Christine Kretz: Absolutely. The initial experiments were fewer and further between because researchers just weren't aware of the access. And they -- we had not yet developed the platforms that Jeff and Rich and other of our commercial service providers have created. So over time the word has gotten out, research has become more and more complex because of the kind of learnings that they have had. And again, that -- the commercial service providers and implementation partners have built platforms right on the station--and I'm sure that they'll talk about those more--that allow people to derisk their research allowing for more and more creativity and more success. In addition, as we learn more, those opportunities become more complex. And so, they take more astronaut time. They take more capabilities from our partners. And they've all risen to that and made those opportunities available. So, I started here only two years ago, and the types of things that I've seen, from the Tissue Chips in Space, which are going to be a game changer, to things that Rich can talk about, the BFF (BioFabrication Facility) and Jeff will talk about his platforms, it's just amazing even in two years the changes we've seen, and what's ahead for us. It's really exciting.   Gary Jordan: I think that's the perfect segue to you, Jeff. We mentioned long-standing relationships with John Mulholland not too long ago with Boeing. Nanoracks has also been one of those long-standing relationships with NASA, with the U.S. National Lab. Can you talk about some of these great things that Christine was alluding to that you've been performing as a commercial company operating on the International Space Station?  Jeffrey Manber: Yeah, thanks, it's great to be here with my friends. You know when you look back on the International Space Station, it's not just the hardware, though I'll talk about that in a moment, it's also a new system. It's new partnerships between the private sector and the government. And so, probably one of the most important legacies at 20 years of the International Space Station is the public/private partnerships and the maturing of that. There's no better examples, and let's say the SpaceX and Northrop contracts and Boeing contracts for cargo and crew with, you know, with companies like Nanoracks, we've invested, you know, considerable money into our hardware, our platforms. We're ready to go as we record this on SpaceX-21—Benji, make sure that thing gets up there, we got our Bishop Airlock on there. And that's a permanent addition to the space station that's privately funded. And we worked in partnership with Boeing on that. And so, the space station for me, is a lot of things. It's first off, it's stability. Bipartisan support. We don't have bipartisan support for much these days. And we have it for the International Space Station. And that bipartisan support has given us the time to make these sort of investments, to work out the ecosystem that's developing in low-Earth orbit. And you know at Nanoracks we have customers from over 30 countries. As I said, we're investing in different platforms. We work everything from biopharma to satellite deployments. We've deployed over 280 satellites from the space station. We've coordinated over 1,000 projects. A lot of folks in my office call them payloads, but people outside of people like us don't know what payloads are--they're projects. And every one of those has a dream, and an aspiration and objective. And now, Nanoracks is recently announced that we're going to be in the research business. We're going to be I think one of the first companies in the industry to be supporting our own researchers, driving our own research in agtech (agriculture technology) and biopharma, and we use Rich's hardware and our hardware and everyone else's hardware. And so, you see that ecosystem developing. So, I guess for me at Nanoracks, we're now 11 years into this journey, and it's been wonderful to see the public/private partnership, partnerships mature with NASA and other government agencies, to see the customer base mature, they get more sophisticated. Now, we're launching multiple times a year, and it's really an exquisite sort of like Swiss clock. And it works, it's wonderful, and it's a delight to be part of.  Gary Jordan: Now, the Bishop Airlock was one of those things that was mentioned, Christine alluded to it, Jeff, you mentioned it a few times. I think it's a good model for -- understanding what a commercial facility operating in low-Earth orbit is. Can you talk about that specific module, the Nanoracks Bishop Airlock?  Jeffrey Manber: Sure.  We recognized early on that the JAXA airlock is wonderful. But we thought that there could be more business, more opportunity, grow utilization if there was a bigger airlock. And we went to NASA and as usual, unfortunately for Nanoracks, we didn't ask for funding. We said, hey, if we put up this airlock--I'll catch on Mike, at some point, I'll think about asking for funding--but anyway, we said, hey, we're willing to invest in having a larger, five times larger, airlock than anything that exists on the station. And so, we went ahead: we got partners with Boeing, we got partners with Thales Alenia and others. And we pretty well self-funded this airlock. We now have enjoyed contracts with European Space Agency, NASA, with some commercial companies, domestic and international. We're scheduled, as we record this, to go up on the next cargo ship from SpaceX. And so there you have a wonderful example of a public/private partnership where the private sector comes up with a concept, comes up with the funding, is based on the investment the taxpayer has made, you know, over the last 20 years and beyond in the International Space Station. And frankly, now, NASA is coming in as a customer, but pretty much a commercial customer because they didn't -- fund us prior, they waited to see that we were moving along.  And so, it's still a fragile market, but couldn't be more excited by the Bishop Airlock. It's going to be a permanent addition to the station. And a great symbol for the growing maturity of the ecosystem.  Gary Jordan: Now Rich, Techshot is another commercial company operating on the space station. Now, through some of your work at Techshot can you describe some of the things you've been a part of, and the value that you've seen in low-Earth orbit?  Rich Boling: Sure, so we were founded in ’88, so, some of our first payloads were onboard space shuttle missions. And at that time, we -- I think we outright owned one payload, but most of what we were doing was building them and turning them over to the agency. In the station era that sort of flipped and now we've developed nearly a dozen payloads of so many different varieties. Payloads, projects, perhaps, maybe we should call them. Many are onboard the station now and others are in the pipeline ready for applied certification. Those things are tools that enable research with fish, plants, cells, whole animals. We have an x-ray machine for mice onboard the station now, and we've done 156 x-rays of mice so far. One of the more interesting ones of those was for the research team of Se-Jin Lee and Emily Germain-Lee--the Mighty Mice that I think a lot of people have heard about. We were proud to play a role in that mighty mouse, Mighty Mice research that showed that some of the treatments they gave those mice, the muscle wasting was not only reduced but in some cases some of the animals came back stronger from space than when they went up. And obviously, that has terrific implications for long-term spaceflight crews. But also, folks here on Earth who have muscle wasting disease could be a real game changer and perhaps one of the most important things that we've been a part of at a station. But others are also very exciting. We're getting ready to launch some squid on SpaceX-21. And so, there's quite a wide variety of equipment that, most of which we provide as sort of a picks and shovels model where it's not our research, it's the research of our customers, and we provide the whole ecosystem of what they need to get some amazing results in space. I mean microgravity has a way of sort of lifting the mask off of biological processes, and allowing researchers to understand more about what's going on inside of a biological system. Sometimes that means that they need to go back in space and continue either research or some manipulation on orbit. But also, it might mean that they've learned something in microgravity that they can apply and replicate on Earth, which also I think is helpful to the industry. You know, but, our payloads, our projects, are divided into a couple categories. One is what we do provide for those customers of ours. But then the projects that we take on for ourselves with our internal science team. And those are related to things like what Christine and Mike alluded to with our bioprinter. So, the Techshot 3D BioFabrication Facility, which we developed in partnership with a company called nScrypt in Orlando, which we think makes the world's finest terrestrial 3D printers, and the bioprinter is something that is a project of Techshot’s, the research is ours, we're doing the research internally now and occasionally bringing in outside investigators when it makes sense. Also, working on a cell factory, Techshot’s in-space manufacturing capability, to be able to make all sorts of stem cells in space for either cell therapies on Earth or for research by our own customers, we can provide a source of cell manufacturing on orbit. And then lastly, we're working on a 3D metal printer for the station as well. That hopefully will be able to prove its use to make aerospace-grade things like titanium, which also will help exploration crews going to deep space, and even on the surface of Mars. But these technical accomplishments I think are definitely important. But Jeff talked about just the infrastructure, whether it's the technical infrastructure or just the policy infrastructure that's been established. And I agree that I think that’s going to be, this NASA democratization of space where I think it has intentionally fostered entrepreneurial participation, I think that's going to be regarded as one of the station’s most important achievements.  And to me, this kind of leadership in technology and enterprise in space seems to be a very American thing to do. We're excited to be a part of it.  Gary Jordan: Rich, you've explained so many fascinating types of research. And I think people listening may be surprised to hear just how many different areas there are--material science, biological science--and some of them may want to get involved as well. Can you kind of draw some lines and -- to connect with some of our panelists today? We have representatives from U.S. National Lab, we have you from Techshot, we have NASA. Can you talk about the relationships with Tech - with Techshot and with all of these different elements that bring this together for those that may also want to get involved?  Rich Boling: All right, so, first of all, part of that intentionality that I mentioned, which I think is not to be quickly dismissed--I mean Mike's office, Mike's been involved in the commercialization of station for a long time, and he talked about how he's seen an evolution of what works and what policies that NASA can put in place to foster this, so, we worked with Mike's office, had a Space Act Agreement established years ago, as I know Jeff has as well--and so, without Mike's office we couldn't do this. We launch on essentially every SpaceX cargo Dragon. And without that resupply capability, especially that returning capability, we couldn't do what we want to do. Once we get into more of a production mode with human tissue, which again, I don't want to give anyone the idea that this is happening next year but it looks good, it looks promising and we need that return capability to bring those things we manufacture for patients back to Earth. And Christine mentioned the allocation and the fact that we can partner with the ISS U.S. National Laboratory to, frankly, not only to manifesting, but also, we rely on them and partner with them and just helping potential customers understand the value of microgravity. They've got some tremendous resources on staff that do a far better job than I do about explaining the value and the benefits of microgravity to material science folks, to people in industry and pharmaceutical companies. And for so many reasons we rely on folks like Christine at the national lab. And then even competitors. Jeff and I, we don't compete in every aspect--certainly, we don't launch CubeSats or things like that--but I do still consider his success my success and success of the industry. This is, frankly, a small industry compared to so many others. And I do cheer on the success of Nanoracks, Space Tango, BioServe and others because we want to grow this pie. We want to -- we want to rally and build demand for ourselves and right now that also means helping others build demand for their products and services. So, it's definitely an interdependent ecosystem right now.  Gary Jordan: Thank you Rich, you can really get a sense of just all the commercial work happening in low-Earth orbit. I think another really important piece of this puzzle is the transportation to and from low-Earth orbit. We're talking about what's happening on low-Earth orbit, but that transportation is another critical piece. Over the -- over the past many years cargo has been delivered to station by way of commercial spacecraft. Now we're bringing on the next generation of human-rated spacecraft. So, I want to shift gears from some of the work on International Space Station to these transportation capabilities. Benji Reed, I want to pass it first to you. We're not too far removed from a huge milestone: Crew-1, the first crew rotation flight on a commercial spacecraft just arrived at the International Space Station with four astronauts, who will now call the station their home for the next six months. First of all, congratulations, what an incredible achievement for SpaceX.  Benji Reed: Well, thank you very much. Thank you for having me on the panel today and -- you know, always massive congratulations to the -- space station itself and the program and all the partners involved in making it happen. Our industry partners and NASA partners, and international partnership. But yeah, I know it's an amazing accomplishment. It represents the work of thousands of people, SpaceX and NASA joint teams, dedication and sacrifice by them and their families to pull it off. And of course, you know the -- most exciting part is for those four crew members, for Victor (Glover), Mike (Hopkins), Shannon (Walker) and Soichi (Noguchi), and their dedication to going up and living and working and doing all of the science and commercialization efforts that we have to do and always, thank you to them and their families for trusting us in that transportation and bringing them up there and bringing them home safely. So yeah, you talk a lot about transportation, and I think it kind of -- looking at the big picture, and Rich used a really good word, intentionality. SpaceX was founded -- and continues to focus as our number one mission is fundamentally to make life multi-planetary. And those aren't just words. That's the real deal. That's what we do. And so, when you look at that picture you say, OK, well what does that mean? Well first of all, the nearest planet is Mars. What do we have to do to make that happen? Well we've got to put thousands of people on Mars. We have to put thousands of tons of cargo on Mars. And probably more, right? Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. Ultimately, you know, a self-sustaining civilization on another planet is going to look like at least a million people. And that sounds mind blowing probably to most people right now. But that's the reality of what it's going to take and that's the intention -- the intentionality and that's the mission of SpaceX, and I think a lot of us. I mean we all really want to see this awesome future where, you know, humans are a space-faring species, where we're carrying you know, our adventure, our learning and our exploration to the stars. And again, this is exactly what we're seeing in low-Earth orbit, and what we're seeing on the space station that has benefits back home, you know back on the Earth, and to a lot of terrestrial applications. But how to do that, so you spread kind of a practical set of steps as you think through the problem, right? Eventually I need to put thousands of people and thousands of tons of cargo all the way on another planet. And what are the barriers to that? So, you look at the barriers and you say, well, number one, I need the technology to do it. And number two, I need to drop the price. The cost is the problem, right? The cost of space is really the fundamental limiting factor in the equation, in this whole experiment of space exploration. The limiting factor is how much does it -- how much does it cost per pound to get, to get things up there. Because that cost not only is a cost directly on your project, right, but it's also, it increases the cost of the project itself. If you're going to spend, you know, thousands or millions of dollars for a launch, or to be a piece of a launch, and now you've got to worry, well I'm going to only send one of these things up there, and it's got to work, it's got to be perfect. And so, you spend a lot of money and a lot of time making that one thing work really, really, really well and have high, high reliability. Whereas when you look at like, well how do industries take off, how do economies take off terrestrially and historically? Well, a lot of times it isn't because you built one car, right; they didn't come off the line and say, I'm going to build one car and it's going to be the perfect car and it's going to work forever. Well they built a lot of cars to start with and there was a lot of people actually working in it. Any invention or, you know, that you look around, there's actually a lot of people working in that. And a lot of different, and a lot of failures have happened. So how do you, you want to be able to, again, you have to drive that overall price down, so there can be many, right? There has to be -- usually we keep using these terms like ecosystem and others that are very biologically-based terms, but there's a good reason for that, right. That's the way life works. Biology is a, it's, you know, there's a ton of different options. There's a huge diversity of opportunity. And that's how you -- that's how you ultimately evolve and grow. And that's what we have to do here too. So, what do we do at SpaceX? So, then you go to the next step of the problem. OK, well how do you drive down cost? Well, the cost of transportation ultimately is the lack of reusability. Right? If you have to build…we always say it, but it's always worth repeating: you get on that big jet airplane and if you had to -- you know, fly across the country from New York to Los Angeles and then you're done with that flight and you push it into the ocean, that's going to be a pretty expensive set of tickets. And so, we started working, you know, from the very beginning on how do we refly rockets? How do we reuse those rockets? And ultimately, you know, all of the pieces of the spacecraft, everything that we can do. Huge partnership with NASA on the COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation Services) program, the original cargo transportation services program and the development there. We developed Dragon on that program. And we developed Falcon 9 on that program. Both of those, the Falcon 9 now, of course, is being used across many different -- for many different customers. And for many different programs, government and private and we see how that works together. We've flown Dragon now to the space station and home 20 times in that time. That Falcon 9 that was developed has flown over 100 times; over 60 times it's reflown, which is great, and really kind of amazing when you think about it, just over the last few years. But we are starting to see that, right, we're starting to drive down those prices. Ultimately, the cost of space and space transportation needs to be driven down by an order of magnitude. You know, by, divide by ten and then divide by ten again, probably two orders of magnitude, to actually get to these goals. And we're going to get there; we're going to do that. And then, so, serving the space station you talk about, and one of the things that was mentioned was the bringing of things home, which is very, very important, right? The goals for going multiplanetary [is not to] send people away and never come back, right? We actually, we want there to be this like interchange, this interchange of transportation. And so, this is the space station and the work we've been able to do with them and NASA and all of these great partners that we've been hearing from today and others, is about that bringing things up and bringing them home and being able to learn. So, from the beginning, Dragon was designed to fly lots of science, lots of payloads to the space station and bring it home safely. And there's other partners out there who are also working on those technologies, too. And also, from the beginning, Dragon was designed to be able to fly people. And fly and maintain life and you know, biological payloads, if you will, for like the, we talked about the mice earlier, and it's cool to hear there's going to be squid on there, and, you know, on CRS-21, the cargo vehicle 21. You know, and there's a lot -- we've been actually flying a lot of biological cargo for a long time and maintaining environments even for non-bio cargo that needed to, on Dragon for many flights, for many years. And then, yeah, now culminating with our Crew Dragon, which is our Dragon 2 line, and then coming up this CRS-21, this cargo 21 flight, will also be on the -- it will be the first flight of Dragon 2, that line, the first cargo variant of that. Excited to bring up the Nanoracks docking area and that's going to be fantastic. Like we're super excited about that. And I said docking area--airlock, say that correctly. But, you know, ultimately, we just see this partnership continuing, you know. We're looking forward to -- I love the fact that the Crew-1 crew that went up just now, they're spending their next few weeks not only kind of getting oriented, but spending a lot of time catching up a lot of the work that's, that's on station that needs to get done, doing a lot of the science work. And then getting ready for 21 to show up, which is going to just have a load of science. So, kind of that's the big picture and that's where we're seeing things heading.  Gary Jordan: Benji you describe so well the ambitions and the model that you're using to create this commercial economy. That's really what we're talking about today, an economy. And I know NASA's goal is to be one of many customers, right, in a self-sustaining, robust economy where commercial partners are in low-Earth orbit. For SpaceX can you talk about some of the ways that you are participating in, existing in this market, right. With Crew-1, NASA was the customer, SpaceX provided transportation so that NASA can have astronauts onboard the station to conduct science, but we want to be one of many customers, right. So, talk about how the Crew Dragon will participate in some of the ambitions NASA has put up like private astronauts in the low-Earth orbit economy.  Benji Reed: Sure, absolutely. Well very similar to what happened with Falcon, right. Again, we developed Falcon 9 as part of that COTS effort and, and for to put Dragon, to take Dragon to space station. And now we again, and a very good example, NASA is one of many customers on the Falcon 9 rocket. And we're going to start seeing the same thing on Dragon as well. Dragon primarily has been [inaudible] space station and home. It's also designed to do free flight. And so, basically, doing orbits in low-Earth orbit, in LEO, and you know, can stay up for a number of days or depending on the different activities that we can do. We can do science in those -- in low-Earth orbit. We can carry payloads in the trunk, in the back of Dragon for non-pressurized cargo. We can carry lots and lots of cargo inside and we can carry people as you were -- as you were alluding to. And so, there are many different options there, right. And now, we're also -- we're already seeing another ecosystem and economy, right, whether we're bringing people up ourselves, you know, customers who are coming directly to us, to be able to fly on Dragon and fly astronauts on Dragon, private astronauts, private spaceflight participants. We can fly them in Dragon directly ourselves as direct customers to us. We can also provide those transportation services to a variety of other companies that are, you know, essentially, brokers who are putting together a whole plan. There are a number of people out there looking at different opportunities for private space stations or private elements of space stations, you know, exactly what Nanoracks is doing, you know, and starting to look, how can we add to the space station as it is, and eventually, how can we create, you know, commercial space stations? And those, all those folks all need transportation services as well. And transportation for cargo, for science and, of course, for people and for astronauts. There are other nations that very much want to be involved in space. And they want to become spacefaring nations with their own astronauts. And that's another opportunity there, where they can actually, now, directly buy a seat and buy an opportunity to fly, and fly in Dragon. So, lots of things and I assure you there's a lot going on and we're going to be excited to see a lot of it. We're already starting to hear some of the announcements and talk about things like that. And then as we move forward, you know, we've got to keep going. That ultimate goal is out there, which is a shared goal with NASA as we look at this commercialization beyond LEO. And we look towards getting to the Moon and getting to Mars and so, we're building the Starship, which will do the same kind of things and be fully reusable. So, very exciting future ahead. And lots of partners and lots of customers beyond NASA.  Gary Jordan: Ven, Benji was talking a lot about the Crew-1 and some of the ambitions there. We're talking about the Crew Dragon. This was part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program; Crew Dragon is one of those vehicles, Boeing Starliner is the other. Can you talk about some of NASA's goals by having this program and bringing up these capabilities for transportation?  Ven Feng: Yeah, absolutely. You know as a Commercial Crew Program and also as CRS (Commercial Resupply Services) program, you know, with, really transportation organization is what their overarching goal of helping to certify and fly rockets and spacecraft as safely and as quickly as industry can do it. So, with these investments, you know, not only do we, are we celebrating the 20th anniversary of the International Space Station, which is a huge, huge thing--now in Expedition 64 of the ISS--but we're also celebrating the ten-year anniversary coming up in just about two weeks here for the first COTS demo flight number one, which was just under ten years ago. And since that time, commercial industry partnered with government and completed 34 cargo resupply missions to the space station, as well as just this year, just in the last six months, we've now, SpaceX has accomplished two crewed missions to the ISS, both with Demo-2 and now with Crew-1. So, so yeah, it's been a tremendous accomplishment for these commercial/government partnerships. So, yeah, so we're very much looking forward to SpaceX becoming a very regular occupant of one of the two docking adapters up on space station. We're looking forward to Boeing coming up in a matter of months. They should be coming back up to space station, we're working very hard to ensure that everything is ready and they're very closely behind. So, it's really a very exciting time. So, when you look back it just, again, the big scheme of things for LEO commercialization, ten years ago the station was established—no, I’m sorry, twenty years ago, the station was established; ten years ago we started these commercial partnerships and now, nearly 40 flights later, we are continuing and going on to the next thing also with not only with SpaceX and Cygnus, on the cargo side, but also Sierra Nevada coming up here in the next year or two.  Gary Jordan: Quite the landscape. Phil, I want to pass to you. Mike Read in the very beginning of this panel talked about some of the recent accomplishments and opening up the station for business and some of the recent efforts for commercializing LEO. Can you talk through some of NASA's recent accomplishments, accomplishments so far to support some of these commercialization efforts?  Phil McAlister: Yeah sure. So, when I saw that I was going to be the last speaker, I'm like, oh, that's great, I can sort of adjust my comments accordingly. The downside is that there's almost nothing more to say, right? Everything, everybody has covered something: I'm like, OK, Rich said that, Mike said that. I'm not sure what I can add to that very good tapestry that I think everybody has laid out for ISS. Obviously, we've had some very recent successes with having the ISS as this critical test bed to experiment. And I use that word literally and figuratively, right: actually, doing research experiments, but also, experimenting on what works and what may not work, in terms of economic activity and commercial activity on ISS and in low-Earth orbit. So, ISS has been a key platform, we're really just seeing some traction now. I think it has to do with the fact that we actually have human commercial space transportation now, available through the SpaceX Crew Dragon and very shortly thereafter, Starliner. So, we're seeing a lot of traction on private astronaut missions that go to the ISS. And not only that, just completely private missions that don't even go to the ISS. There was a recent announcement by SpaceX and Space Adventures just to go in space, and not to dock with ISS. And NASA will have nothing to do with that project. And that's exactly what we want to see. And we've also seen some successes that, on the demand side, on what we're actually doing in the ISS. We're seeing some more commercial development projects that are coming up to the ISS. So, so, when I think of the overall sort of commercial LEO development activity that we're doing, the ISS is obviously been a critical test bed for that. So, I think everybody at NASA when we think of the ISS, we want to give it the Vulcan salute, and say “live long and prosper,” but this 20th anniversary is an awesome celebration, but it's also a reminder that the ISS is not going to be around forever. It could experience an unrecoverable anomaly at any time. And so, as amazing as it is, it's also a reminder that that is our, that is our single toehold to continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit. So, it's my job to ensure that we do not have a gap for whenever the ISS retires, whenever that is. And so, when I look back historically, Benji and Ven also mentioned, you know, we started with cargo and then we have crew -- Commercial Crew -- and I think our long-term vision is then to have commercial destinations. And once we have all three of those in low-Earth orbit, primarily driven by private sector interests, you have this self-reinforcing ecosystem. I know we've used that word a lot, but I really think it applies here. Self-sustaining, and self-reinforcing and that's what -- that's what the commercial LEO development program is all about. We are looking at, eventually, having multiple space destinations. Again, the sort of tenuous nature of just having one platform up there, as amazing as it is, reinforces that I think we need multiple destinations. Just like we have multiple commercial cargo capabilities and soon commercial crew capabilities, having redundancy and having multiple capabilities is going to be key. And I think when we look in destinations, when we, we've talked about all the different things that we can do in low-Earth orbit, not every destination is going to be good for every kind of application. So, we could see sort of tailoring of this destination for this particular market, this destination for another different kind of market. But you look overall, and you have this sort of rich tapestry, capability, redundancy, that I think we all want to take advantage of. Not just NASA, as Mike said, we are going to have continuous requirements in low-Earth orbit. We're going to be a good anchor customer for these capabilities. But as we've said many times, it's not just a cliché, we want to be one of many customers. So, we're hopefully going to enable that capability to be sold to other customers. And I do agree with Benji completely, the key is cost. Right? As amazing as the ISS is, we've always been conscious of cost with the ISS, but it wasn't really developed with that as the primary driver. It had other things that we were trying to accomplish. When you partner with the private sector, they have a laser focus on cost and schedule. And then you bring NASA's experience with human spaceflight, our 50 years of human spaceflight, and you put those together it's a very, very powerful combination. And we saw it with cargo, we saw it with crew, and I want to bring those lessons learned with commercial space destinations and make sure that they are online whenever the ISS retires. And I think once that happens, NASA can then set its sights deeper and really allow the economic activity in low-Earth orbit to really take off.  Gary Jordan: Phil, I think you said it so nicely. And I'm sorry for making you the last speaker but you said it that, you know, we've covered so much. Man, we talked about the International Space Station and some of the great work happening onboard with a lot of our commercial partners. We talked about the transportation capabilities. And Phil, you ended so nicely with under, giving us an understanding of what this framework, you know, what is a robust ecosystem, understanding sort of what that looks like in low-Earth orbit. So, I'd just like to end there and thank each and every one of you for taking part in today's discussion. What a truly enlightening and fascinating discussion we had today. It's been an honor to host such an esteemed panel and chat with you all today. So, for those listening and tuning in, thank you so much.

[ Music]  Host: When I got to NASA in the mid-1990's and the modules of the International Space Station were still being built, and there were days when you'd be forgiven for wondering when this whole thing was even going to get off the ground, the program goal of promoting commercialization of space and space research didn't seem like such a big deal. Now, it's hard to imagine what the station would be like today if we didn't have the vital contributions from and participation by private companies, including those represented in today's discussion and many, many more. As we move ahead in the Artemis program, look to see how the lessons of the value of commercial partnerships is being applied to the next goals of space exploration. There's more to come on this celebration of the space station’s 20th anniversary. The next discussion focuses on the critical importance of the partnership built by the United States and NASA and nations and space agencies from all around the world. That's coming up in a couple of weeks.

            "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 187, “The View from Mission Control.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. Today, we're going to give you a peak at the operation of the International Space Station flight control room. Every single American spaceflight with an astronaut onboard, starting with Freedom 7 in 1961, has been run by a team of specialists in a Mission Control Center, which has been located here in Houston since 1965. Rather than make astronauts responsible for coordinating all the aspects of the spaceflight while they are flying it, engineers with expertise in all the relevant systems work together in one location to move a mission towards its goals. A team is on console in the flight control room any time there is an American mission in space, which has been the case since the launch of the first element of the International Space Station in 1998 and the arrival on orbit of the first permanent crew, a little more than 20 years ago. And NASA has sponsored a series of panel discussions in recognition of that 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the station. We brought you the first of those, our episode 184 last month. And today, we bring you a talk focused on the work done by Mission Control Houston. The moderator is NASA public affairs specialist Brandi Dean, from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. She's also a mission control commentator. And she'll introduce you to the Deputy Director of Flight Operations here at JSC, Norm Knight, the Chief Flight Director, Holly Ridings, and the Deputy Chief Flight Director, Emily Nelson, Flight Director Pooja Jesrani, former Flight Director, David Korth, and International Space Station Deputy Program Manager, Kenny Todd. For a great look at an element of American spaceflight you don't always get to see. So here we go.  [ Music]  Brandi Dean: Hello and welcome to our ongoing celebration of 20 continuous years of human presence onboard the International Space Station. I'm NASA Public Affairs Specialist Brandi Dean. On November 2nd, 2000, the very first expedition crew arrived at the International Space Station and since then there have been an unbroken string of 241 astronauts from 19 countries onboard supporting science experiments, performing spacewalks, and teaching us how to live long term in space. But although the crew members in space might be the most visible piece of that puzzle, they are only a tiny percentage of the many, many people who have to work together to make sure missions are safe and successful. We're here today with some of the people that work on the ground, and in particular, through our Flight Operations Directorate, and we have a few International Space Station program stowaways here with us as well. I'm going to let each of them introduce themselves and tell a little bit about what they do, and then in honor of the anniversary we're celebrating, I'd love for each of you to also tell us where you were 20 years ago -- when Expedition 1 was just beginning. And we are going to start first with Norm Knight.  Norm Knight: Well, let's see, Brandi. It's really an exciting day, and it's great to be on this panel. A little bit of my background. I've worked in Flight Ops for many years. I'm currently the Deputy Director of Flight Operations. You know, thinking back 20 years ago, which some days it seems like yesterday and some days it seems like a long, long time ago, I had been group lead for one of the shuttle groups that managed the main engine, solid rocket boosters, and external tank, and was recently selected as a flight director, so I was really transitioning from shuttle to station. So exciting times, exciting memories, and I look forward to the rest of the panel discussion today.  Brandi Dean: Definitely. Thank you, Norm. Now we're going to go to Kenny Todd.  Kenny Todd: Hey, good morning, Brandi, and good morning to the rest of my esteemed colleagues on the panel. It's good to see all of you. I'm the deputy program manager for the International Space Station. Have been for a number of years here. But, work very closely with the entire Flight Operations community and have done so for close to the last 20 years now. When I think back to where we were -- where I was 20 years ago, obviously I wasn't in this position, but at the time, my focus was over in avionics and software. And one of the biggest challenges for a program such as this one, where you have hardware literally being built all over the United States and other parts of the world by different countries, one of the challenges was trying to figure out how to integrate all that hardware and software, and it was a big effort in that time frame back ending the last century when we were really starting to get this program off the ground, and in orbit. And so at that time, I had one camp working real-time operations on the avionics and software side, making sure everything was going OK on orbit as we -- as we started to bring up these different systems, and at the same time I was off trying to figure out the next flight in the queue, and how to make sure that we were all going to be good to go and trying to find problems on the ground so we didn't have to find them and give them to these -- to these flight directors later on when they have to deal with them. And again, good to see everybody.  Brandi Dean: I'm sure they appreciate that early work. Next up is Holly Ridings.  Holly Ridings: All right, well, good morning, everybody. I'm Holly Ridings. Today, I am the Chief Flight Director in the Flight Operations Directorate and it is pretty exciting to sit here today, you know, after 20 years and look back. You know, see some of the same faces on this panel, and really have an opportunity to celebrate everything that we've done, and so today, I'm the Chief Flight Director, but if you go back 20 years, I was just starting out at NASA as a Flight Controller, just newly minted, and was able to sit console for the very, very beginning of space station. And so for a while, I would tell everyone I had the entire history of space station in my head, and now it's gotten so complicated, I don't think I can remember it all, but for a while I could -- I could go flight by flight by flight, and that was how I organized my whole life. Not birthdays, not holidays. Space station flights for the milestones, and really still are, actually. That's kind of how we mark time in our world, so super exciting to be here, and I hope you enjoy what we talk about today.  Brandi Dean: Thank you. Next, let's go to Emily Nelson.  Emily Nelson: Good morning, and hey to everybody. So, let's see, right now, I'm the deputy Chief Flight Director in the Flight Operations Directorate, and we're still also Active Flight Directors. 20 years ago, I was also starting out as a Junior Flight Controller. The Expedition 1 launch marked a transition where one role that we had early on was going to retire because the space station, which had actually been in orbit for a while was going to have people on it, and so we were going to retire one position and move into a full team, so I was excited to be transitioning into additional responsibility and getting maybe to become a little more senior as a Flight Controller someday, but I was a pretty baby Flight Controller back in that point in time.  Brandi Dean: That's so cool. How about we go to David Korth next.  David Korth: Hey, good morning. It's good to be back among friends. I hung up my Flight Director spurs several years ago, so now I'm the Deputy Manager of the ISS Avionics Software Division, what Kenny was doing 20 years ago. 20 years ago, I was sitting console in what we call the blue FCR, a much smaller version of what's behind Emily right now, and I was the Lead Planner for Expedition 1, and so, you know, I looked back, and I was reflecting these last couple of days on what we've accomplished since then, and thinking how much preparation went into Expedition 1. And as Emily mentioned the uncrewed station that existed for a year and a half, two years before the Expedition 1 crew showed up and how much work effort we all put into working with the Russians trying to come up with what the plans were going to be, how we're going to integrate things together, and when we finally cut our first plan and uplinked, that's when, you know, this is real. This is actually happening. So, and clearly a lot has transpired both with all of our partners, and the vehicle itself, and the evolution of operations, so I'm glad to be a part of this group today.  Brandi Dean: Must have been such an exciting time. Finally, we're going to go to Pooja Jesrani.  Pooja Jesrani: All right, good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here with all of you. Like Brandi mentioned, my name is Pooja Jesrani, and I am a Flight Director. I was selected in 2018, so I am one of the newer flight directors in our office. I was selected with five others making a class of six. And so, I am, you know, one of the baby flight directors, you would say, but have had a lot of experience now at NASA. In 2011-- sorry, I should say in 2000, I was in 11th grade. I was in 11th grade and had a lot of space posters in my room, and it's -- you know, I was very inspired by space, and wanted to be where I am today. So very excited to be here. Thank you. I saw a lot of heads shaking with the 11th grade, but...  Brandi Dean: Yes, this is already so much fun. So, now we're going to back up a little bit. Although a lot of this group supports Flight Operations in mission control, that's not everything that Flight Operations does by a long shot. So, Norm, since you're the deputy director of Flight Operations, why don't you give us an overview of what Flight Operations Directorate is.  Norm Knight: OK, Brandi, and 11th grade. Goodness, that's a shocker. So, Flight Operations, we live in a lot of acronyms, so you hear FOD, it's synonymous with Flight Operations, it's Flight Operations Directorate. And really, what we are, is a service organization for all the major programs. For development and mission execution. And so, what I'll talk a little bit about and give you an overview today is really for station, but it does support all programs, and you know, the program is our customer. We're an org of about 2,500 people, and we have three major functions within Flight Ops. You can think of us as kind of like a tripod. One leg of that is our astronauts. We have about 47 active astronauts today. The other leg is Aircraft Operations. We call it AOD, and we have about 60% of the aviation assets for the agency within Flight Ops. We have 19 T-38s that are used for spaceflight readiness training. We have a cargo transport, the big guppy you've probably seen flying around. We have some high research aircraft, used for science and training, and then we have a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream V, which are used to transport the crews home after landing and get them back reunited with their family. And then we have the plan, train, fly part of the organization, which is really the biggest part of FOD, although it all works together, but really that plan, train, fly is what we do for the program. We really start planning and training each of these ISS increments, which are about six months long, about a year and a half out, and the teams work very hard to take the program requirements, metabolize those into a plan, a very detailed plan of how to accomplish this. We train the astronauts, we train the flight controllers, we integrate the teams, and we get ready to go in and execute that in the real-time environment, and that plan really starts from when the astronauts leave their families to go to launch all through all activities on orbit to the time that they come back to Earth and are reunited again with their families. Where you see a lot of this really culminate is in the Mission Control Center. Many of you have probably seen mission control, whether you've seen it in person or in photos. That's the command and control center for the International Space Station. These teams work 24/7, 365 days a year. The Flight Director is really the conductor in these real-time teams, managing all the systems onboard, and the purpose of the teams in there is to manage the systems and also to provide crew safety for this orbiting laboratory in real-time. The teams typically send about 30,000 remote control commands from the ground to the space station a month to manage this platform. So, it's very interactive, it's hands on, it's tactile, and it's very rewarding. You know, Flight Operations, we're very rich in tradition, we have our foundations of what we call foundations of Mission Operations. They're leadership tenets, not unique to FOD, as we say, but really, for any effort that requires leadership. It's discipline, confidence, competence, toughness, teamwork, vigilance, and responsibility, and to see leadership attributes that define our culture. And this culture, in addition to the flight rules and procedures, is really what provides the framework for the critical decisions and the operations that are ongoing, as you see in real time today. The teams are trained to expect the unexpected, to improvise and overcome, and to work with a lot of other team members, both here at JSC and other centers, to always ensure astronaut safety, vehicle safety, and achieving the mission objectives that are set forth by the program. And FOD is a little bit unique in that as a support organization, we can knit this together across major programs with international partners, with cargo vehicles, with crew vehicles, and payloads, integrating them all together in both the development and real time environment, again, making it work in support of our customer, the program.  Brandi Dean: I think that sets us up now for maybe Kenny Todd to come and tell us, I think, it might be confusing to people that the people you see supporting flights, sitting in mission control and flying the space station don't actually work for the space station program, so maybe you can explain kind of that relationship between FOD and the space station program.  Kenny Todd: Sure, Brandi. Yeah, you know, the part that everybody sees on TV is mostly astronauts and flight controllers and flight directors, I mean, that is the face of human spaceflight. That -- those are the people you see, and quite frankly, those are the people that we the program have entrusted with this $100 billion international asset, and so, as Norm said, they had the responsibility given to them by the program to train our astronauts, you know, make sure we have a flight control team that's certified and ready to go, and multiple levels deep in failure response, and I think through the course of the history of not just this program, but all programs, you can see that the tenets that Norm laid out today have really been the foundation, which has been used in all human spaceflight programs and been executed very successfully, so anyway, yeah, Flight Operations is from a programmatic perspective, there are so many different facets of the program when you look at the engineering, the safety, you know, the people who manage our spacesuits. It's a huge program. But somebody has to have that responsibility to operate the vehicle day in and day out, and we look to the Flight Operations Directorate to do that, keep the crews trained, keep the vehicle safe and flying in a good way every day. Now we have a control center over in Huntsville, Alabama that their primary focus is going to be making sure that while Flight Ops is taking care of the vehicle and keeping everything safe, that they're working with the principle investigators and getting the science done onboard station. So, there's a nice sharing of roles there, but at the end of the day, we look to the Flight Operations director to make sure that we take care of the vehicle, take care of our crews. And again, we compliment that with a large work force of folks that make sure that we hold each other accountable from the standpoint of the technical requirements or safety requirements, keeping our suits healthy. And so anyway, that's kind of where Flight Operations sits in our bigger, overall program.  Brandi Dean: Thanks, that was a really good explanation. And I think it brings up that you know, this space station isn't the first program that FOD in some form has supported. We've been -- you guys have been working with all the human spaceflight programs pretty much since the beginning. But I think, probably, the space station's first -- that first expedition was kind of a turning point for you guys because, among other things, it meant that mission control had to be open 24/7, 365 days a year. I think Holly and David, you guys were already flight controllers at that point, so maybe you remember a little bit about what that transition was like.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so maybe I'll go -- I'll go first, and then I'll hand to David because I think our perspectives are maybe a little bit different. Right, so I came in right when we were building up the team of folks, the flight control team, that would work with space station. And so, you know, I didn't start on the shuttle side and then transition over like Norm, and Dave's got some experience as well. So, to me, you know, the 24/7, 365 is really the only world I've ever known. And we supported from the space station side, you know, round the clock. And then, obviously, when the shuttle came up and docked and we did joint missions together, really laying the foundation for so many ways that we partner with all of our international partners and then now our commercial partners as well, and so, you know, I was lucky enough to come and be some of the very first people to get certified on the space station side and learned the ropes from that perspective. And you know, Expedition 1, any time you do anything for the first time, right. You know, there's always excitement but also trepidation because you've spent so much time trying to anticipate and consider how it's all going to work together and then you sort of go live, and then you know, some of it works and some of it doesn't, and actually that's probably the best part of our job, is getting to solve all of those problems, right. That's what all of us love to do after all of the hard work's been put in to prepare. So that's kind of my, you know, perspective on it. You know, you're at the starting gate and you hit the go button. In station, you hit go and you never stop. It just goes. And so, again, you know, after 20 years, that's the only world I've ever known, but I know that Dave and Norm had some more experience on the shuttle side before that than I did, so I'll hand to one of them.  David Korth: Yeah, thanks Holly, and I, when I first got hired into NASA I came in as a -- in the space station operations planning area and we were always 52 months away from launching something. And so, our management said, \"Hey, you know, it might be good for you guys to get some flight control experience if you're going to be part of the flight control team for space station early on.\" So, I got to spend four years doing shuttle flight control and flight planning. And so, for me, I got to see, you know, the heritage of NASA at least when I was young, you know, maybe even as young as 11th grade back when I remember shuttle, and the fact that, you know, I could make a flight plan. And if I wanted to change the flight plan, I took out a pencil, I erased a couple of lines on a piece of paper, I drew some new lines, and then we faxed it up to the shuttle and voila, there's the plan. And that was the change. And then all of a sudden, this new era of international cooperation and, you know, jointly agreed to operations and coordination’s -- all these different words that were, like, you know, certainly we coordinated, and we had international partners fly on shuttle. But now, if I wanted to make a change to a plan, I had to go call the Russians, and then after -- you know, years later, it was the Russians, the Japanese, the Europeans, the Canadians, we all had to agree on what the plan change was going to be. So, cooperation and mutual agreement on how we're going to do things really became important. And so, for me, that -- I saw that transition. And the other aspect, and I know Norm's got some -- he saw this thing, transition in mentality from the U.S. perspective of lot of experience flying short duration missions. You know, and we were even very proud of ourselves with our 16-day extended duration orbiter missions. And then we go talk to the Russians about this new space station project, and they're like, you know, we've been flying Salyut, we've been flying Mir. We know long duration spaceflight. And so, we had this ideological sort of conundrum where we both thought we were right and we both thought we had the right approach, and it was really sort of a meeting of the minds, where we both had to come together. And we brought in some new technology and some new approaches. They brought in years of experience dealing with long duration crews and how to operate something continuously. And so, Expedition 1 was kind of the culmination of all that discussion and began the adventure that we kept learning. And things have changed quite a bit, and the relationships that we've got with the Russians have changed and evolved quite a bit. And then we brought on all of our partners, so I saw that as kind of one of the main benefits to me of being part of the station is opening your mind to a different approach on how you can do things. And, you know, relying on your heritage and your experience, but using that to build something jointly together.  Norm Knight: Yeah, Brandi, I'll add to that a little bit, what Dave and Holly said. You know, the fulcrum was really on the shuttle side initially, and so, like Dave said, you know, our big, long duration missions were 16, 18 days backs on the shuttle. And so, we had shuttle teams up working shuttle. We had station teams working station. And it was a paradigm shift for a lot of the organization to go from these sprints on shuttle really to this marathon on station. And you could see over time it was -- shuttle was, you know, king, per se, and that's the way things were done. But slowly and surely you know, evolution of human spaceflight was really transitioning to station and beyond. And so, the shuttle you could see starting to fade. And even though it was bringing up the cargo, that mentality was, hey, this is the new way for the evolution of human spaceflight. And so, that mentality of marathon is really, it's exactly what we're doing today. It's what we'll use today for lunar and Gateway and Mars. And it really, I think, has provided a good proving ground for this. And we have changed significantly from when we started the station to now. Our whole flight control team model has changed, because, you know, before if we took that shuttle model, you have a lot of people on console and you're running those folks 24/7, it's not efficient. You burn folks out. And so, really, what you see today in the station flight control room from a Flight Ops standpoint is what you get. It's a very small agile team working, again, to make sure that the astronauts are safe, and those mission objectives are being met. And we continue to evolve. So, it's been, it's been fun to watch.  Brandi Dean: Well, the word marathon is a good one. Because the next thing I wanted to talk about was Emily is, I think the record holder for most times spent in -- basically in that room at mission control. She has the -- I think the most shifts for a flight director. So, I think we'd love to hear from her on kind of what a regular day on console is.  Emily Nelson: Yeah, it's maybe a dubious honor. The flight director I took the honor from told me I shouldn't be too proud of having so many shifts in this room. So when I think of, you know, what a day in the life of space station is like, I think all the way back to my -- when I first started working console for space station was actually 1999 as a shift duty officer about a year before the first crew showed up. And so back then, this was an uncrewed ship and you had fairly junior personnel, obviously, keeping an eye on it in the wee hours. And that was really just -- like, I can remember back then, the whole shift was really just about making sure that the -- we acquired comm every rev and that the comm was still working and that nothing looked funny. And that occasionally we'd end up getting a call from our trajectory officers warning us, “hey, there's a piece of debris that might be heading towards the station. You should call everybody and get them working that.” But, you know, super simple operations. And then over the years, you know, you get through the assembly phase. By the time Shep and company were onboard, we -- you know, that was just a little while before the lab showed up. So, then we started doing research. And we started really shifting through the years, you know, through assembly, where you're doing a lot of things for the first time. And any time you do anything for the first time, you're going to learn, maybe, a lot. And you're putting new systems onboard and you're learning about those systems, and you're building this space station one piece at a time every couple of months until you get to a point where you kind of call it assembly complete. At that point, now, for many years, we've been using this amazing platform for research. This is our orbiting research platform. And so, a normal day today looks really different from a normal day on any one of those 21 years along the path. We are supporting our crew members as they're executing a lot of research projects. Those research projects are different every month. We have a seemingly never-ending stream of new research that's coming online and getting to orbit and then coming back home and getting replaced by more. Occasionally, we'll have some systems that aren't behaving themselves, and so our teams will have to sort through those things. Occasionally, research doesn't go exactly as we planned, and so our team in Huntsville will have to work with the crew to sort out why it's not working the way it's supposed to and see what we can do that will still accomplish some science while working around whatever challenges we have. Occasionally, our international partner friends will have issues on their sides of the space station, and so we'll coordinate with them as they're working through the challenges to get their systems back online. Like last night, we had problems with a valve in one of our CO2 removal systems, so we had to work around that. We had our JAXA friends, we're operating their robotic arm on the outside of the space station to get ready for a satellite deploy tomorrow. And we were installing some radishes in a plant habitat so that we can grow some radishes onboard. I mean, it's a really diverse set of activities that are going on every single day, and it's just different every day of the year for 21 years. I don't know how many jobs out there, when you show up for work, you just don't have any idea what it is. You know, it's going to be totally different from the day before. And that's really what has just been so fun about getting to work on space station for all these years.  Brandi Dean: And I love that you haven't even left today yet. So, great background.  Emily Nelson: Yeah.  Brandi Dean: I think Holly had something to add.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, it was only color commentary, right. So, you know, we are all engineers, and so we have this giant sheet of metrics, you know, spreadsheet of metrics. And so, Emily watches the numbers go up and down, and, you know, so last week, she's like, \"Hey, I need to work some console,\" you know, so when people need help, she pitches in. So, she's been actually on the night shift for the last couple of days. And she has to keep the very serious, very fancy trophy for the more shifts on console, which happens to be one of those number one foam fingers like you get at a ballpark. So, you know, we all have very serious jobs, but we also, you know, try not to take ourselves too seriously. You know, we live and work in mission control. All of us are there, you know, almost every day, right. So when you see us do a panel like this, it's easy to hear the stories and think about 20 years, but, you know, we're here because we love it, and we still spend, you know, time in the building on console. You know, Kenny is -- I think Kenny sleeps in his office in mission control sometimes. So, you know, anyway, I just thought I would throw in a little bit of color commentary, so that's it.  Brandi Dean: That's perfect. I love that, a foam finger for your trophy. So, for those who would aspire to such greatness, earlier this year, we had a call for applications for new flight directors. And I know based on the many emails that I got, there is a lot of curiosity about what it takes to be a flight director and then kind of how you learn once you get there. And since Pooja is the most recent addition or one of the most recent additions to that group, I thought maybe you could tell us a little bit about how that worked for you.  Pooja Jesrani: Sure, absolutely. So, my story for becoming a flight director was that I actually interned at NASA back in 2006/2007, and then came back on full-time in one of the flight control groups for the International Space Station. I worked in the [Attitude Determination Control Office] ADCO group, which is in charge of the way the International Space Station basically flies around the Earth. I was in that group for about ten years before I was selected to be a capcom, which is a capsule communicator. A capcom is the person that talks to the astronauts onboard the International Space Station. I did that role again then for a few years and then applied to be a flight director for the International Space Station. I was selected in 2018. Once I was selected, we went through about a years’ worth of training to get certified to sit on console. In that years’ worth of training, we took a myriad of classes. Basically, all of the classes that the astronauts actually take before they fly on station. As well as we did a bunch of simulations. I know simulations really tested the worst day ISS scenarios. And we really hope that those scenarios never happen in real time, but those scenarios really prepare us for those days on consoles where things don't go as smoothly as planned. So, once we got to go through all the training classes, as well as the simulation, we sat on console and did real-time OJT to really learn the ropes of what happens every day on the International Space Station. And after that real-time OJT was complete, we were signed off by our Chief of the Flight Director Office to sit our first shift on console, which was a really memorable day for me because I was able to invite my family and friends to attend my first shift and sort of naming ceremony.  Brandi Dean: So, you've got to tell us now, and then probably we should go around the group, what name did you give your, I'm not even sure what you call the noun there.  Pooja Jesrani: Yeah, sure. Our team name. So, I -- my team name is Unity. And I am the 94th Flight Director in the Flight Director Office. I'll let you go around the horn.  Brandi Dean: How about we'll go -- we'll go kind of in reverse order, David.  David Korth: Yeah, I'm Odyssey flight.  Brandi Dean: And how did you pick that?  David Korth: Well, I've got to relive this moment on console again. For me, it seemed very appropriate because it kind of highlighted the journey that I took that sort of went through a lot of different turns, twists my own Scylla and Charybdis, so to speak. And ended up where I wanted to be, when I started, when my boss asked me when I first got hired, where do you see yourself in ten years, it was a little more than ten years, but that's kind of -- it kind of related to me and personified where I was. Where I -- how I got there.  Brandi Dean: That's great. Emily?  Emily Nelson: Yeah, I'm number 70 and my team name is Peridot. I had -- let's see, there's -- one Christmas, my mom had given me some peridot earrings and I was not familiar with the stone, so I go look it up and come to find out it was a -- it's a gemstone that you have to have an iron rich environment to develop the gem stone. And they're frequently found in meteorites. And so the image I had in my head was of somebody landing on some planet somewhere, someday, and turning over a rock and seeing a familiar stone, you know, a stone that we have at home and then they find it on some planet far, far away. And so, I thought that would be a good kind of reaching forward name for my team.  Brandi Dean: That's a great story. Holly?  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so, I'm realizing that we're going to leave Kenny out, so I'm sitting here trying to think of an honorary name in real-time, but we may just have to take inaction because --  Kenny Todd: I'll just be Kenny. How about that?  Holly Ridings: You're just going to be Kenny? Awesome. OK, so, I -- Viking flight is my name. Flight Director number 62 there's been less than 100 in the entire history of human spaceflight. Less than 100 flight directors, which is why we all know our numbers with this new class that Brandi mentioned coming in we might -- we might break 100, we'll see. Maybe not, but we are getting close. So, I'm number 62, Viking flight. The reason I picked it is before I came to the Johnson Space Center, I actually worked at Goddard Space Flight Center for a little while. And my mentor when I worked up there was a man named Gerald Soffen and he was the project scientist for the Viking landers that landed on Mars. And so, as a tribute to him, by the time I was selected as flight director, he was not alive anymore. Also, as a tribute to thinking ahead, going to Mars, which we all want to do someday. Headed to the Moon with Artemis and then onto Mars. That's why I picked -- I picked Viking.  Brandi Dean: Very cool. And Kenny, yes, sorry about that but if you have a -- if you have one that you want to throw out there now, we can take it.  Kenny Todd: No, I'm good. This is a special group of people and no, I don't want to tread on that tradition for sure.  Brandi Dean: All right, and Norm.  Norm Knight: Let's see, I'm number 51 and my color is Amethyst. And the reason I chose Amethyst, no surprise with the color of the tie here, is I'm a traditionalist more. And so, colors were chosen as team names early on with the first set of flight directors, and so, if you take the first three flight directors Chris Kraft, Gene Kranz, John Hodge -- they were red, white and blue, accordingly. And I'm very patriotic. And so, you mix red, white, and blue together, you get amethyst. And so that's how it came about. So, there you go.  Brandi Dean: That makes total sense. Well, so speaking of kind of the origins of flight directors and going back a little bit in history, I think one of the things that most people think of when they think of a flight director is that, \"Houston, we've had a problem\" line. And dealing with that, the square peg in the round hole. I know that this is a job that can -- that can get your blood pressure going up. So, I think you probably have some good stories and maybe we can start with David, because I know he has a pretty interesting one.  David Korth: Yeah and actually got to share it with Norm. So, we were in the control room at the same time. Yeah, one of my interesting stories on console was certainly the U.S. EVA 23 back in July of 2013. It was a pair of EVAs that we were doing. The first of which was July 9th, so just seven days earlier. And we had -- and we learned through this, we don't have enough time to walk you through the whole series of events that led up to it, but there were a couple of key things that I took away from the experience. First and foremost is to build on what Pooja just talked about. You know, when you get certified as a flight director, you go through rigorous training. Especially rigorous simulations. And the intent of the simulations both for you as a flight director and as an upcoming front room controller is to, you know, quote, throw the kitchen sink at you. Make you -- give you the opportunity to experience those really awful days where a lot of things are going wrong. How you prioritize, how you make decisions. How you lead a team through, navigate through those problems to come out the other end where everything is stable. You know, that's at least the minimum goal. Everything stable. But what I found, you know, you certainly aren't going to have the opportunity to simulate exactly what's going to happen. But what it does do is it prepares you mentally to deal with things that are unknown because you fall back to your training. You say, \"Hey, I've gone through all these things.\" You're thinking this stuff through your mind. I've gone through many scenarios where bad things happen and you can't just freeze up. You can't lock up, you got to keep thinking. And so, falling back on the training that Pooja had to go through to get certified. And that when we go through for all these different dynamic events, whether it's EVAs visiting vehicles, any other kind of major event that we do on station, we try to simulate and spend time building team, so you understand how you and your team are going to react. Building that kind of trust. And building confidence -- self-confidence in yourself that you can get past a tough situation. The other piece of that is the reliance on team. It's not one person that's going to solve a problem. You have to rely on a team. And to extend that, you know, this particular EVA we had two astronauts outside. Chris Cassidy, who just returned home from a second expedition. And Luca Parmitano, an ESA Italian astronaut who also came back from station for his second tour not long ago. So, kind of the end of the story was it all ended well because they went back. But at the time, what we learned is that, you know, our international partners, we had an EVA with two people. One international, one U.S., and they had absolute and implicit trust in the U.S. flight control team to lead an EVA and to resolve problems. And somebody asked me in the press conference shortly after the EVA you know, did you -- how was the communication with the ESA flight control team and were they concerned? Were -- you know, what did they ask you and how did you communicate with them? And, you know, it made me think and realize that, you know, this partnership that we've created is based on a lot of trust and mutual trust and that we didn't -- you know, other than them following along and understanding that we were running this EVA and we had the best interest of all crew the safety of everyone regardless of what badge or flag they flew under really hit home to me. So the event itself, it took a, you know, we terminated the EVA in an hour, just over an hour into an EVA with something that did not appear at first life-threatening and after -- it was after we declared termination that the event started to go downhill quickly and, you know, there was a little luck involved that we terminated when we did. And that the EVA itself was set up to where the astronauts were not as far away from the airlock as they could have been had this event occurred late in that EVA, where parts of the station would have taken them longer to get back to the airlock. It was certainly traumatic and then certainly when we got back into the airlock and got the helmet off, an hour and 41 minutes PET, or Phase Elapsed Time, you could see all the astronauts on the station, our Russian colleagues, everybody in the airlock doing what they could to help get that helmet off. The goal was get that helmet off as quickly as you can. A liter and a half of water in a helmet when you're in space is, you know, putting your head in a fishbowl. And so, it was great to see the international cooperation there at the very end. I also had the pleasure of working HTV-3 with Holly. That was the Kounotori 3 Japanese cargo mission that ended up aborting when we released it. It was one of those that we berthed, we brought it in and berthed it to the Node 2 Nadir and then we released it with a robotic arm. And a number of different events transpired such that it went forward instead of down. And then that sort of caught our attention there in real-time. But that was working with the Japanese control team. And a lot of communication back and forth. And again, it fell back to the mutual training that we did with our Japanese colleagues to build trust, the cooperation, the understanding of how each of us was -- to react in tough situations. So that when something unforeseen happened, there wasn't, you know, a multinational panic. It was, “hey, we can deal with this and get through this together.” I think I'll stop blabbering on at this point.  Brandi Dean: Yeah, I would imagine there might be some other good stories out there. Anybody want to share kind of the most heart-stopping time on console that they've had?  Holly Ridings: Yeah, I'll do a quick one, right. So, was on console early on. I was a flight director and we were bringing a progress vehicle into the space station. And so, typically that's an uncrewed cargo vehicle the Russians built. It comes up, flies up to the space station automatically. Normally what happens is it has an antenna that moves out of the way when it gets close, such that then it makes room for the docking mechanism to mate with the space station without any interference. And unbeknownst to us on the ground, that had not happened correctly. It had not retracted properly and so, the progress is coming on in and of course that antenna created some structural interference. And so, when it tries to dock with the space station, it didn't -- it didn't work correctly. When you have two vehicles in space and you try to put them together, you do what's called free drift, right. You don't want firing jets moving around on either one of them. They don't go together nice and neat. So, we're in a position where the progress was coming in and the space station is drift. We're trying to put them together, and of course, it doesn't work quite right. So, then we had to figure out what to do. And this is our Russian colleagues trying to figure out how to go ahead and get what we call, you know, structural mate such that now we can start firing the thrusters again. You know, have attitude control of the space station. And so, you know, that story may not sound you know, sort of adrenaline pumping. Maybe when I tell it very technically like that, but this is not something that happens. Typically, we rendezvous lots of vehicles to the space station. It usually goes really well, and so having one where you're unable to finish completing the docking, but also not being able to get off the space station because you've kind of got this incomplete mating. Now you've got your space station in drift. If you stay that way too long, you're not pointed in the right direction, you don't have power, you don't have communication. And so, that situation can start to start to go badly fairly quickly. And so, you know, as Dave was pointing out it's a team thing. And in this particular case, you know, our Russian colleagues worked closely with us to figure out what to do. You've got the safety of the crew onboard, and that's the most important thing you're thinking of in that situation and wanting to get the space station, you know, back to a place that's safe for them in terms of power and consumables. And obviously, this structural mating that's going on. So, sometimes things go wrong, and you have to figure out what to do. In that particular case, we got, we got enough structural mating that we were able to do that. There's hooks, clamps that kind of pull the two vehicles together and get back into a safe state. But it was very sort of adrenaline-inducing for a period of time while we figured out what to do. And you know, Brandi, you always ask these questions and we're all trained to tell them in these, like, super dry, boring voices. You know, because that's what we do on console when things go wrong. And I'm not sure it quite conveys you know, the situation to folks out there. But, you know, I decided I'd try a little bit, so hopefully people understand that you know, that's our equivalent of heart-pounding, where we have these very calm faces and sort of monotone tones, because that's what we're trained to do.  Emily Nelson: Yeah, and just to add some color-commentary to that one, I remember that day because I was with a team that was doing a training run upstairs. And word spread that, because it was pretty unusual for us to not dock totally normally. And so, word had spread upstairs of this. And we pretty much just, like, everybody took a pause and we moved our data from our simulation training data to the real-time data to just kind of follow along, you know, with bated breath from upstairs to see what are they going to do? How are they going to solve the problem? You know, we had a whole team that was following along that really -- it was -- yes, when you describe it technically and, in the moment, you can't get all, you know, we don't make it a big, exciting event. But I will tell you that from another room in the building having nothing whatsoever to do with the op, we were all watching because it was a, kind of a really scary event.  Kenney Todd: And I'll, let's see. Brandi, I'll jump in kind of from a program perspective. I don't sit and do the actual console work. But you know, I look at it from a programmatic perspective. We've asked the Flight Ops team to, you know, take care of the crew, take care of the ISS. And if something goes wrong, you know, my perspective is get us through the shift. Get us stable. And then, we'll step back as an integrated group, take a look and see what our options are. Try to figure out how to go -- how to go forward. And at least one of the examples that I can think of, and maybe one of y ‘all can help me remember. For some reason, I think it was 12A or 13A. We had a shuttle dock to station. And for whatever reason, the Russians had a computer failure. And we thought, \"Oh, no big deal.\" And then, they had another computer failure. You know, like, well that's unfortunate for those guys. And then you realize, well, that's really unfortunate for all of us because -- we need them in order to be able to stabilize the station so that shuttle can leave. And we had absolutely no clue as to what happened with the Russian computers. The Russians didn't really have a good understanding. There was -- there was a lot of concern. I'll put it that way because we were really in a situation where we couldn't keep shuttle forever trying to figure out what to do. We were concerned about overall maintaining attitude control should we try to undock and not have these computers that could control the propulsion systems. Pooja, you probably remember this. But anyway, so anyway, I just remember that was a very concerning time for us at the program level because we were still building station. You know, we were still quite a ways from being done and to have a problem like this where you're really looking at each other going, \"How are we going to get out of this?\" I mean, this could you know, be a step in a very bad direction if we try to let shuttle go and not have a good way of ensuring that we can clear it from the station without any kind of contact. So, it was at least over a period of days. It was something I think a lot of us lost sleep over working with the entire team, engineering, our operations team, our safety communities, our partners, our Russian partners trying to figure out, because it wasn't just as simple as rebooting that computer and bringing it back up. It was a much more involved technical issue that again, kind of felt like it brought us to our knees there for a period of days and I assume some of you might have remembered that one.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so I'll pick up for just a few minutes because I was actually on console. I worked that -- I worked that mission from the Flight Director Console. It was actually my very first joint, you know, joint mission. So, I'd been certified before that and I worked space station shifts, but that was my first joint mission on the ISS flight director team. So, I came in, I was the crew overnight shift. We put the crew to bed, and I came in, and the lead of our team said, \"Well, we're in free drift and we can't figure out how to get out of it. We needed the computers on the space station to work and then be able to hand back and forth in terms of the shuttle taking overall control of the combined space station/shuttle. But we were trying to get back to where the space station, you know, took control of that. Like Kenny said, we couldn't have the shuttle do that forever. And so, I came in and we're free drift and we don't know how to get out of it. But here's the lesson I learned, right. So, one of the more senior flight directors was the lead. And she looked at me and said, \"OK, so while we're figuring out how to get out of free drift, you know, what else can you do?\" We actually needed to move the mobile transporter which is a piece of equipment where the robotic arm can ride up and down the length of the space station to set up for an operation the next day. So, you know, as a new flight director you're just -- your kind of like, \"OK, here's our problem.\" You know, she was looking up and out. Like, \"Hey, let's keep moving forward safely while we're still solving this really bad problem over here.\" You know. And it was in my early flight director career, one of the most important lessons that I've learned. What can you do to move forward even when faced with a problem that, right now, you don't know how to solve. How do you move forward, you know, safely, of course. And so, we move the mobile transporter, because we had to be free drift to do that anyway. We happen to already be free drift, while we're over here trying to figure out how to solve the problem. The other piece of that is when you have a problem that big, everyone just shows up. Like, it's amazing. You don't have to make phone calls. People just know, like Emily was saying earlier. The team in the other room's looking at the data, everybody's at home watching NASA TV, you know, people are getting things on their phones now more than they used to because phones are a little more prevalent now. But the data just gets out, and people just show up. What can I do to help? And we formulate what's called a team four where you have another set of folks go really, really focus on that problem. Leaving us in the control room, again, to continue flying the mission as much progress as we can make safely. So, you know, those are like, two of my biggest flight director lessons that I carry with me from that specific incident that that Kenny brought up.  Pooja Jesrani: I'll just add one quick thing. So, I actually started at NASA about two weeks after that shuttle flight and it was the biggest buzz in town. I mean, the amount of conversations that happened after that shuttle flight and all the things that the team had done to recover, I mean, that was sort of my -- getting my feet wet and really learning all about what FOD does. It was a great experience to start learning from.  Brandi Dean: Yeah, that's so cool. I feel like we could listen to your battle stories for a long time, but I know you've got other things to get to today. But I did want to wrap up a little bit by talking kind of about how Flight Operations Directorate is still evolving as we have new programs coming online. I know Holly, you supported the first SpaceX cargo mission and Pooja I think is getting ready to support the first Boeing commercial crew mission as well. So, maybe you guys can talk a little bit about how things are -- how we're adapting to those new demands.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so you can probably do an entire panel on just that topic, right. Kenny was there as well, Norm was sitting behind me. So, I was the flight director, the NASA flight director sitting in the ISS, you know, flight control room responsible for the very first Dragon that came to the space station. So, this is 2012. To put that in perspective, we've now done over 20 of those, if you count that demonstration headed into the 21st under the space station cargo contract. So, I mean, two-ish a year for the last, you know, almost ten years now. So, amazing to see how far we've come. You know, when you sit through the first time, we've talked about this when we talked about Expedition 1, right. You put in all this blood, sweat and tears planning, trying to figure out how to do this. Again, Kenny remembers all of this. And then you go live, and it doesn't work exactly like you planned. And that's where we really get to do our jobs. That's what they pay us for, right. Is to figure those things out. And so we got about, you know, 120 meters from the space station and our navigation sensors that communicated with the SpaceX Dragon didn't look quite right, so we got to sit there for a little while and figure out how we were going to manage that in order to get the two vehicles to communicate and navigate in -- navigate in safely. And ultimately, we did figure it out. It's another one of those stories we're like literally heart pounding. But, you know, when you tell it afterwards it's like, OK, well, we sat there and calmly worked through it. You know, we had our engineering support. We had the program folks, you know, Kenny was in the other room. Norm sitting behind me, and we figured out what to do and do it safely and were able to bring the vehicle in. We did have to sit, you know, 120 meters from the space station for a while making sure navigation sensors were working correctly between the two vehicles. And so, you know, from my standpoint you look back. And now, where we are with commercial is really amazing. You know, a tipping point in human spaceflight for us to be able to incorporate a commercial partner and bring them safely into the space station. But to us, right, who started, you know, at the beginning of the space station, it was just another opportunity, right. We had done Expedition 1, we figured out how to incorporate, you know, over time, all of our international partners, add their modules and their vehicles to the space station. And this was just one more in a continuum. And so, we look forward now with all of the pieces that we continue to do on space station and, you know, on into Artemis. And for us, that's, you know, continuing to build on the skills and the culture. You know, at the end of the day it's all about relationships, and teamwork, and trust. And you go and you figure out that combination with every partner, with every provider, with every team that we interact with. And, you know, that's really the amazing thing to me about the International Space Station. One of the most amazing things. And so, again, I could talk forever, but you know, Kenny and Norm were there, as well. So, I'll hand to them.  Norm Knight: Well, I'll provide just one aspect of it that Holly hit on. And it's the teamwork, and it's relationships. And, you know, it was a fantastic day to give Dragon birth. But if you look at the journey to get there, that was really what made it special. Because, you know, the commercial cargo came on the heels of the Constellation program being canceled. NASA diverting funds from government type work into more of the private and commercial industries to where NASA buys the service instead of actually building the vehicle. So, that was the forefront of that. And I'll tell you that the -- dynamics between commercial and NASA and government at that point was pretty toxic. It was -- you know, NASA funding has gone down. It was given to commercial; it was just -- the timing was bad, and the environment was not great. And it really took, you know, Holly and her team and Kenny and the programs to really start helping build trust, as Holly said. Because we were doing a lot of finger-pointing back and forth. And it was getting us nowhere. And until, you know, those relationships started to be built, the trust started to be instilled in that you need us, that NASA recognizes that we needed them as well. We're not the enemy, we're the solution. So, are they, and we have to work together. So, we started focusing -- instead of pointing at each other, we're pointing now at a common goal. That common goal of successful commercial cargo. And that is the foundation -- and the success of that is the foundation we're resting on today with commercial crew, it's what we're going into with the Gateway and Human Landing System. And it all goes back to that. So, leadership matters, relationships matter, and people and trust matters. So just a great success story.  Kenny Todd: Let's see, and Norm, absolutely, I agree with you and Holly both. I mean if we look back at when station started, did we know that we were going to end up in this model? Not necessarily. I mean, we sort of had to adapt the mission along the way based on the guidance and the direction that we had been given. And again, that brought some new people into our circle that we didn't know about when we started this. But, one thing I talk to people about up and out a lot is the fact that we have a space station culture. There's not -- every partner, every -- whether it's commercial, whether it's international, everybody brings their aspect of how to do things and how to look at problems and how to look at challenges and how to accomplish things in their own way. But, at the end of the day you have to figure out how to make that work with everybody else. And what ultimately comes out of that mixer, if you will, is a space station culture. And we understand each other. I like to tell people, you know, the technical problems don't really know international boundaries. They don't know contractual boundaries. They are problems you know; you solve them the same way. The physics doesn't change just because you talk a different language. And so, you have to get together, you have to figure out how to work together to do that, and we did it early on with the partners, our international partners. And I think with our commercial friends, we're starting to see that same thing as both Holly and Norm talked about. You know, the early part that storming-forming-norming thing that there was a little bit of storming early on and it took us a little bit, but I think in the end, you know, we had arrived at kind of a cultural understanding of how to get things done, and it's been extremely successful, and, you know, I think it's going to carry us forward, as Norm said, as we start to not just work with our international partners, but also commercial partners and trying to go live around the Moon and go do some work on the Moon.  Pooja Jesrani: Yeah, and Brandi -- oh, yeah, I was just going to mention that I think this is just a very exciting time for younger generations. You know, the last time we flew off of U.S. soil was in 2011 for our last shuttle flight. And so, to get to see DM-2 this summer fly, I mean, it was the buzz around town, it was the buzz around the world, you know, to get to see these astronauts go to the International Space Station and fly off of U.S. soil. And I think the SpaceX team is doing an outstanding job and we have, you know, a flight coming up in the next few weeks as well as Boeing working really hard to do the same thing. So, I think the next few years are going to be super exciting.  Brandi Dean: Definitely. A lot of excitement these past 20 years and a lot more excitement to come. I think we are just about pretty much out of time, but I do want to give Norm a chance to just kind of wrap up for us a little bit what we've talked about, today.  Norm Knight: Well, Brandi, great discussion, great panel. And, you know, I don't know how many folks have had the opportunity to go out and see an ISS viewing. Where you go out, look at the night sky, early morning sky, and see a station fly over. But if you've not had that opportunity, go do so because, you know, the station didn't happen on its own. It was, you know, one vote in congress, it took a lot of teams to put this orbiting outpost in orbit. And so, when you look up at this magnificent laboratory that's the size of a football field, it's nearly a million pounds of mass in orbit orbiting the Earth about every 90 minutes. You realize it's real. There's human presence onboard, there's been human presence for the last 20 years and, you know, it really is an engineering marvel. And to me, miracles you know, miracles do happen. When you have a vision, you provide the leadership, the perseverance, the political support, and teams that manage this thing day in and day out and have been doing that for the past 20 years. It's incredible. And, you know, it's a great orbiting laboratory for science and research. And it's also being used as a great, platform for developing hardware that's going to evolve us to the Moon and Mars and beyond. So, this is amazing. 20 years has gone by in the blink of an eye, but the relationships and the teams that have made this all happen are what's going to evolve us to getting on the Moon by 2024, making that a reality as well. So, I think I can speak for all of us that, you know, being part of this is just really special. And just really glad to be here today with our friends and see just what this has become and how it's evolving even into the future. So, I'll leave you with that.  Brandi Dean: Thank you so much, Norm. That's a great idea. Definitely go out and wave at Kate, Sergey, and Sergey as they are flying over. And then later this month you'll get a chance to cheer on the Crew-1 crew as they launch for the space station on their SpaceX Dragon, as well. This is just the second in a series of six panels, so you're going to want to watch out for the rest of this series. Coming up is going to be all about science. That's the next one that we'll be holding, so you can watch out for that. Thank you so much for joining us today and here's to 20 more years.  [ Music]  Host: Well, that was an interesting discussion. I hope you had some insights into the way human spaceflights are managed here on the ground. It was also a nice trip down memory lane for me. I was the commentator on Holly Ridings' planning team during that loss of station control event she described. It was summer of 2007, shuttle mission STS-117 was visiting the station during Expedition 15, it was every bit as riveting as she says. Also, an update for those of you who keep track of these sorts of things. This discussion was recorded prior to the arrival of the astronauts on the SpaceX Crew-1 mission. As of now, there have been 242 different human beings who have passed through the doors to the space station. There's more to come. The celebration of the space stations’ 20th anniversary continues. Our next discussion focuses on the benefits of science research on the station. We'll hear from the people leading the science and research efforts on the station as they talk about the importance of that work and the benefits it's already generated, for those of us who are stuck here on the ground. I'll also remind you that you can go online to keep up with all things NASA at NASA.gov. You can find the full catalogue of all our episodes by going to NASA.gov/podcasts and scrolling to our name. You can also find all the other exciting NASA podcasts right there at that same spot. NASA.gov/podcasts. The panel discussion in this episode was recorded on November 4th, 2020. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Gary Jordan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, and Jennifer Hernandez in pulling together this podcast. And to the NASA JSC External Relations Office for assembling this great group to give us some insight into mission control. We'll be back next week.",

            "description": "Dan Huot (Host): Houston we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 93 Space Medicine. I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today. If you're new to the show, we bring in the experts here at NASA to talk about all the different parts of our space agency. Recently though I got a chance to get out of the studio and head up to Comicpalooza in Houston where we headed up a live recording of the podcast in front of a live audience of a couple hundred of our closest friends to discuss the science fiction and science fact of space medicine. Joining the esteemed panel was Gates McFadden, most famously known for her portrayal as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise on the TV show Star Trek Next Generation. She shared her insight into how space medicine worked in the far off future of Star Trek and how she prepared for the role and assumed the character of a space doctor. And, joining her on the panel were some actual space doctors including Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a NASA astronaut and former flight surgeon who flew in space last year and also doctor's Kris Lehnhardt and Richard Jennings. We go into detail on who they are at the very beginning of this panel. This is the first time we've recorded a podcast from outside of our home here at NASA. And, this is the biggest live audience we've had yet. So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to another live recording of Houston We Have a Podcast, again, with Serena Aunon-Chancellor, Richard Jennings, Kris Lehnhardt and Gates McFadden, enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Well, we'll jump right in. Thanks everybody for being here. This is our panel on space medicine, all things space awesomeness and also our first live recording outside the Johnson Space Center for Houston We Have a Podcast. So, thanks for being here today. All right, if you're unfamiliar with us, we do podcasts on all things human space flight. We get to talk to some really incredible people, actors, scientists, astronaut, engineers, the people doing amazing things that inspire us and are really pushing, you know, humanity into the next generation. And so, today though, we're going to be focusing on space medicine. What happens to humans when you go into space? How do we keep you healthy? How do we prevent you from getting sick? How do we really keep you going when you're up there for extremely long periods of time? And, I'm going to go down the line real quick, introduce my esteemed panel, and then we will jump right in. I'm going to go to my notes because all of these people are insanely accomplished [laughter] and I want to make sure I don't leave anything out. So, starting off, right to my left we are joined today by Gates McFadden, everybody's going to recognize her.  [ Cheering ]  Gates McFadden: Thank you thank you.  Host: And, Gates obviously famous for her betrayal of Dr. Beverly Crusher, which I must say one of the coolest name in Sci Fi history [laughter], hands down. She was the Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise D and E under the Command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the show Star Trek Next Generation. So, that show aired from 1987 to 1994. Gates though has directing choreography and puppeteering experience in film, films like Labyrinth and the Muppets Take Manhattan. And, was in a number of other pictures like the Hunt for Red October, personal favorite of mine, and When Nature Calls. And then, she's taught at several universities including the University of Southern California, Harvard, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the University of Pittsburgh. So again, let's hear it for Gates.  [ Applause ]  And then next to her, she's kind of easy to pick out. She's the astronaut amongst the group. This is Serena Aunon-Chancellor and she is a NASA astronaut and medical doctor. She's been on the International Space Station. She recently completed a long duration stage. She was flying above all of us for about six months while she was up there in orbit. She was there from June to December 2018. So, recently acclimated back here on earth. She's has a background though in internal medicine and she as a flight surgeon before she was an astronaut and conducted a whole bunch of experiments onboard the Space Station including once impacting diseases here on earth and doing some cancer research on the station. So, Serena, thanks for coming out today.  [ Applause ]  All right and then we have Kris Lehnhardt. And this is a mouthful. He is the Element Scientist for Exploration Medical Capability in NASA's Human Research Program.  Gates McFadden: That's like techno-babble.  Host: All right, and so, he also is at the Senior Faculty with Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Space Medicine and Department of Emergency Medicine. He's board certified I emergency medicine not just here in the USA but also in Canada and he works clinically in the Emergency Department Ben Taub Hospital here in Houston. Some of his main research interests are in medical care an extreme environments, so places like space, people in the military, and out in the wilderness. And then, he's also a pilot because again, like I said, you guys can't just have one job, can you? You have to do like 40 different things. Also a pilot, he's a Reservist in the Royal Canadian Air Force and advanced open water scuba diver. So, let's hear it for Kris here with us.  [ Applause ]  And then, finally, down on the end, Richard Jennings whose a Clinical Professor in Space Medicine at UTMB and he's a Flight Surgeon for Space Adventures and he's a member of the Safety Advisory Panel to Space X, a couple of people might have heard of them, and a Medical Consultant to Virgin Galactic. And, he also served as a NASA flight surgeon, so something Serena's also done. So, he was there from 1987 to 1995 and continued to provide care until 2013. While he was at NASA he was the chief of the Flight Medicine Clinic and Chief Medical Operations for the Space Shuttle Program and he served as the director for the UTMB NASA JC Aerospace Medicine Program as well. And, as a Lead Flight Surgeon for Space Adventures, he's actually supported five missions on the Russian Soyuz Spacecraft over in Kazakhstan in Russia. That's a pretty interesting place. And, if you can corner him afterwards, ask him a bunch of questions, I guarantee you he's got some really cool stories about that. He was also a President of the Aerospace Medical Association and currently serves on the board of the Aerospace Medical Association Foundation. So, once again, let's hear it for Richard and for our entire panel for being here today.  [ Applause ]  Okay. And, that was the, that was the abridged version of everybody's biographies, just a really let it sink in. So, before we really get into the nitty gritty of space medicine and medical technology and stuff like that, I want to start off with something that's, it's really pertinent to a place like this, at Comipalooza, and that's inspiration. A lot of people, one of the great things, if you work at NASA or you know somebody that does, they're extremely passionate about what they do and the same is true for actors and artists, they're extremely passionate and they're always driven. So, I want to know, what kind of took each of you down that road? What was the guitar in the pawn shop window moment? And starting off with Gates, what really kind of drew you to be an actor, director, choreographer and, kind of, more importantly, what drew you to something like Start Trek?  Gates McFadden: Well, to be honest, I was pushed when I was young to be a performer. I always, personally, would play in the dirt pile making cities. I was like really into the relationship of people and space. Not necessarily the final frontier but just kind of the dirt pile frontier. But, as I got older and I was performing more and more and I was learning about theater and I majored in, at the university, I graduated from Brandeis University. And then, I met a man, I took a workshop at Harvard and he changed my life. So I would say he was the catalyst. He was someone who actually came to NASA. He was invited to NASA. And, he was unknown, pretty much, in the United States. But, he was very into analysis of movement. He had started in sports medicine and then he went into theater and he was friends with some of the most famous French artists of that period. But, he believed that artists had a responsibility to help change the world for the better. And, we actually studied things like architecture, we had to understand music and had to compose music. It was sort of like, really he synthesized a lot of ideas that I had had, because I liked more than one thing. I liked the whole process of creating something. And so, when I came back to the United States, I was much, all my friends had gone to New York to try to get an agent and make it. And, I was less thinking about my career but thinking about how could I effect change in the world or how could I be part of, participate in it? And so, I started doing, you know, literally started doing some street theater, doing different things. And then, I started getting teaching positions because I knew how to teach his techniques which were very much in demand. And so, I would say, that was the catalyst that got me thinking about the world. And, it was complete chance that Star Trek happened. I was not, really, I had done a lot of theater in New York City as an actor. I performed many, many, many plays and loved it because I loved transformation. So when Star Trek came up, I had actually already auditioned for a play I wanted to do with Linda Hunt and a director name Des McAnuff. So, believe it or not, this is real, I turned down Star Trek to go do this play for $400 a week. But you know what? I loved doing the play and I had no comprehension about the Star Trek Universe. I am so humbled now because I have learned more from the people I meet who have watched Star Trek. And yes, of course, I learned watching the show and I loved when my character would be involved in the Hippocratic oath working against the prime directive. I love that conflict. I thought that's really what we need to look at things like that, you know, the ethics of things, all sorts of things. And so, I think, that’s for me, that's really how I started to appreciate more and more how crucial Star Trek has been for so many people and for me. Because now, I feel such a bond in a community to people who really walk the walk, people like, I was telling them, Jim Wetherbee who commanded several Space Shuttle missions, became a friend. And, we emailed from the Space Station. I actually was like, you know, and I asked him. I said, why are you—you're doing it, I'm just pretending. And he said, “Yes, but you're the inspiration. And I like to think I have a lot of Jean-Luc Picard in me.” And, I went oh okay I get it, okay. So, I'm Dr. Crusher, I get it. And that kind of hope and inspiration, because our show was so positive. It wasn't dystopian. It had a really, you know, we can work together as a community. I think that has been so important in my life right now to be a role model to young people both as a single parent, in the show, and also as a medical commander. And so, anyway, it's a lot of talk, sorry I talked so long. But, that, for me, since I can't really walk the walk like they do, I'm honored to be part of this panel.  [ Applause ]  Host: Serena.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, absolutely also honored to be part of this panel. This is really fun for me because this is the first time I've ever been here. And, it was just neat walking around a little bit prior to coming up here. But, for me, I do remember probably at the age of eight or nine watching Shuttle missions launch over and over. And, for me, that is the memory that sticks in my mind as a catalyst. And my parents used to watch me do this. My father was an engineer, my mother was a novelist. And so, my father watched me, you know, staring for hours at the television watching anything I could about the Space Shuttle. And, he said, “Do you want to work for NASA?” And, I said, “I think so.” And he says “Well then, you need to be an engineer.” And so they just, it was sort of a matter of fact. There were no questions, not doubts. They just began to push me down that path. And then, I felt like very door that's opened since then has really led me here. Now, for me, I did major in electrical engineering, and this is out on the East Coast. But then, midway through my engineering career, I had a lot of friends who were also in the premed program. And, they kept coming to me saying Serena, we think you should be premed also. We think you should be a doctor we think you'd be really good at it. And, I really pushed them away at first because I thought of all the work that was entailed with that and all the memorization. And I said that's too much work I don't want to do that. And they said no Serena we really think you should do it. So, I went home over the summer and talked with my parents and they said fantastic we'll help you do that. And, I made that shift. And honestly, it was the best decision I have ever made because I am still a practicing physician. I absolutely love being a physician. It is my passion. And then, as I was training through medical school, I was still thinking how was I going to work for NASA? I didn't know how this was going to work. So, I just went on the internet and started looking up things and found this really great rotation at Johnson Space Center about aerospace medicine. It was a clerkship that was offered and I was just a few months away. So, I applied and came down and learned all about the facets of aerospace medicine, space medicine, the effects on the human body. And then really, I met this man, Dr. Richard Jennings, that you'll see down on the left. He has really been my great mentor throughout my entire career. But, he is the one that really introduced this field. And so, I applied to get into this special training program after medical school for both internal medicine and aerospace medicine. And, he was one of my program directors. So, Richard and I have know each other for a very long time and he's really meant quite a great deal for me in this path. Once I finished training, I became a flight surgeon and began looking after astronauts and their families and spent most of my time in Russia. So, I got a little bit of a taste of what it was like and then applied for the Astronaut Corps in 2009 and was honored to get in. It was a long journey to my first flight, almost ten years, actually since coming in the corps and finally flying. And after landing almost four months ago after 197 days, people ask what it was like and it's almost hard to describe unless you're up there. Just the beauty of the earth, but really, more importantly, the science that we did. I was highly impressed at the caliber of science now that impacts everyone down here including every person in this room. So, it's great to be back, number one, because I get to be here with my family, do events like this, and smell the earth again.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right, Kris.  Kris Lehnhardt: It's going to sound a little corny, but, my path to being here started with Star Trek. I remember being a little kid, lying on the floor in front of the TV watching reruns of the original series with my mom. And, I was a little kid in Canada and, if my accent had not already given me away as a Canadian, I really loved the idea of doing something in the space sector. But, Canada's a pretty small country and we have a space program, but it's a pretty small space program. And, I thought I wanted to be a vet. I liked animals and I wanted to take care of animals. And, I met with a high school guidance counselor who said to me, “Don't you really like space?” And I said “Yes.” And, he said, “Well, how are you going to do space stuff if you're a vet?” Well, NASA has actually selected veterinarians previously to be in the Astronaut Corps. But, not for a long time. And so, I just switched species. [laughter] I became a medical doctor and I did that because there was a Canadian astronaut by the name of Dave Williams. He was an emergency physician. And, I thought, that sounds like a cool job. Maybe if I do that, I can be an astronaut. Well, I'm sitting beside an astronaut, so, that's pretty good. But now, I get to help design medical systems for space exploration. And so, if you can't be there then being part of the mission is the next best thing. And, it's been a real honor to do this job and to be up here on this panel.  Gates McFadden: Incredible.  [ Applause ]  Richard Jennings: I'm not sure why, if you have two susceptible individuals and they both get exposed to an infectious agent why one gets it and one doesn't get it. But, in 1955, I saw the movie Conquest of Space and then in 58 we had Explorer 1 images on our bulletin board in class. And, I got extremely interested in space and I followed every launch, every scrub getting up at 3 in the morning listening to Shorty Powers from Mercury Control talking about that. And then, later on, there was a TV series. And, there's a real power, I think, with television and movies that effect people. And, I saw Men Into Space which starred William Lundigan. Chuck Berry from NASA was a consultant on that show actually. And then, eventually, I decided I wanted to be Bill Douglas or Chuck Berry. They became people that I wanted to be. I wanted to be taking care of the doctor—be a doctor taking care of the astronauts in the Space Program. And, in college, instead of writing on the Beowulf and it’s imagery or whatever, I got to write about the medical aspects of the Space Program and I've been doing it now for the last 50 something years.  Host: All right.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right, we're going to jump right in. We are going to take questions at the end, in the last 15 minutes or so, so start thinking now. But, let's jump into kind of what we're doing in this day and age. So, Serena, you were a flight surgeon, you were an astronaut. What does the medical picture look like? How are we preparing people to go to space right now and how are we maintaining them while they're up there and once they come back?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah so, that's actually pretty complicated. Most, there's not, so, the preparation to go into space, most of that involves training of Space Station systems and, you know, we of course stay health and get as much exercise as we can. But, once you're in space, you're in space, you're in microgravity and we can't stop microgravity. It's going to effect the body and does it in multiple ways. For me, the first few days, you just don't feel that good. Your stomach doesn't feel that good, your head feels a little big, you have this massive fluid shift that's occurred. So, you feel really stuffy and full. And, of course, you're floating everywhere. So, you're desperately trying to grab onto hand rails with your hands because you haven't learned to use your feet yet and you haven't learned to really move like a monkey. And that's, we got really good at that towards the end of the mission. And, of course, immediately the things that are occurring that you don't feel, your bones, you muscles. You're no longer loaded by gravity. And so, those start to, in essence, break down almost immediately. You don't feel it. But, after six months, if you don't do anything to counter it, you'll know. And so, we actively try and keep our bodies as healthy as we can. For example, we lift weights every day onboard the Space Station. And, people say well how do you do that? Well, we have a special device that creates a load using vacuum tubes. And, we're able to do squats or bench press and all kinds of exercises. We run on a treadmill where we're wearing a special harness that loads us down. We don't get our full body weight but we kind of gradually move up. So, we've gotten to be pretty good at countering a lot of these changes. Now again, that's really for only about six months in low earth orbit. So, the game really does change as we move on towards Mars, have a service day and come back. And we're still working on many, many ways trying to keep ourselves healthy all the way there and back. Because now, you've got other things that kick in like space radiation, extended stays away from family. You can't see the earth anymore. There's so many aspects to preparing the human for exploration missions. It'll boggle your mind. But, that's really what we all work on most of the time.  Gates McFadden: That's amazing.  Host: And, we've gotten here after, you know, 50 years of exploring. Richard, kind of take us through the Genesis of all that. When we were starting to launch people into space, we didn't know what the heck was going to happen when they started floating around. I mean there were wild theories about some stuff. What were those kind of early days like?  Richard Jennings: This July the 16th will be the 50th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11. And, I'd like to get back to Apollo 11. But, what is really remarkable about the Apollo program and Apollo 11 is that a very young president—a very young president, after a 15 minute suborbital flight said that we should send a man to the moon and bring him back safely and do it in this decade. I don't think he pronounced it decade. But, nevertheless. So, you can't look at Apollo 11, I don't think, without considering the flow that occurs through Mercury, Gemini, and then Apollo. And, a lot of people aren't aware that there was a huge controversy with regard to Mercury. Mercury was where were going to send our first astronauts into space. Allen Shepherd was the first one, John Glenn was the first to orbit. But, there was a roaring controversy where a lot of the scientists I the country did not think we should do it that we would kill them. And, in fact, a Wiesner Report was filed on January, early January given to Kennedy that we shouldn't do it, we should be doing animals, doing robotics and those sort of things. And, because of that, one we protected ourselves a little bit by taking astronauts who had to go through a five phase selection cycle they were extremely fit, extremely health, and shorter. They couldn't be over, 5 foot 11 was the highest they could be and they were all in their 30s. And, sometimes we give up our youth and our health to get the money like to day the spots that people are doing now for $40 million. But, they were very healthy. And so, because of this report and other problems, at the end of January, the last day of January we launched Ham, a chimpanzee on a flight, which was, a lot of people don't talk about it. But, it was sort of a semi-disaster. He ended up experiencing 15 G's and he also almost, the capsule almost sunk before they could get it out of the water, took in 900 pounds of water. But, that gave people some confidence we could launch Allen Shepherd. And, we previously launched a squirrel monkey and a rhesus monkey Mable and Ms. Baker earlier. So, we had some pretty good confidence. The Russians had launched Belka and Strelka. But, they had a big meeting in March and they said okay let's go do it. Unfortunately, what happened on April the 12th of 1961, we weren't the first. Yuri Gagarin orbited one time then. So, finally, whenever Allen Shepherd flew, it was May the 5th, we had delayed long enough that he wasn't the first into space. But, the whole idea of the Mercury Program was could humans survive and would they be an effective crew member inside the vehicle? And they were. They did very well. The flights were limited, the first two were suborbital, two five hour flights and then a sixth rev flight and then a 34 hour 22 rev flight, very limited. The only medical thing that came out of that, we only did pre and post flight physicals, not much during the mission, was that they had a little tendency, when they stood up to get light headed and have a fast heart rate.  After Mercury, Gemini came along and that's the one that, both from a technical and a medical standpoint, led to Apollo 11. Two thousand man hours of time were accumulated in space. They had, because we were going to do lunar rendezvous for our landing on the moon, we had to learn how to rendezvous and dock. And, we also had to learn how to do EVA. And so, that was critical and it was done in Gemini. But, from a medical side, most of our lunar missions were going to be 12, the longness was going to be 12 days. So, they needed a little margin there. And so, they started making the flights longer. And, Gemini 4 was 4 days and to be cautious, they just doubled it. Gemini 5 was 8 days and then Gemini 7 was 14 days. And, during those missions they did this in counter measures and other things. But generally they were doing pre and post flights except for those kind of flights. It was a huge success. The program was a huge success. We did find that people do have a little bit of loss in blood volume, they lost some weight. EVA had a real high load, really, work load was much higher than anticipated. They had cardiovascular de-conditioning. And, the orthostasis, passing out when you stand up, got a little bit worse. But, overall, the feeling was, we could go to the moon. And, we didn't have to do a whole lot of testing during the Apollo program. Some of the things we learned early in the Apollo program was the Russians had had motion sickness when they launched. In fact, their second flight, with Titov they had motion sickness and we got into that on Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 because we had a bigger vehicle and they were moving around. We also learned the value of the Health Stabilization program, quarantine before the flight because we had sickness on Apollo 8, sickness and a delay of the mission on Apollo 9. And, Apollo 13, you're all familiar with the measles exposure. And so, after that, they came up with the Health Stabilization program. But, Apollo 11, when we got to Apollo 11, they felt pretty comfortable at that point. Apollo 10 had been a real similar mission. Just from a medical standpoint, they did not have a lot of things on board, for example, no dental equipment, none whatsoever and just a few medicines because they were so concerned about weight. To give you an example, when Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon, they had six Band Aids I their kit. They did have 12. But, they took out six Band Aids because they were too heavy.  Gates McFadden: Oh my God.  Richard Jennings: And, they were really trying to make the kits, you know, lighter and lighter. And so, there's some really big constraints on what you could take. And, each of the astronauts had to test those drugs so we wouldn't have an untoward, you know, an untoward reaction to them. When we did the mission, this one went fine, probably less medicines used on Apollo 11 than any other flight. They did use some aspirin. It's interesting, Mike Collins had had knee problems and pain in his knee on Gemini 10 and he had it again on Apollo 11, he never told anybody about that until he wrote his book later on because they usually don't want to tell the doctors that something that might cause problems with a future flight or something. But, he did have that. When they decided to get into the lunar module and land on the moon, they did take medicine to make the GI system slowdown called lowmodel. They did that, they used two of those. And then, when they got ready to land, they used scopolamine dexatrimine. Because a spacecraft like a capsule, and we're finding this out, you know, now with the capsule we're using landing on water, they're great in space but they're really bad in boats. And, when you land in the water and the moving around, people really get sick. But, they did not use too many and they had a really great flight. One thing that people forget though is we were worried, after Apollo 11, about back contamination, in other words, them, not us bringing something to the moon but something on the moon that was deleterious to humans. So, when they came back before they got out of the capsule, they put on these biological oscillation garments that they wore then they went into a mobile quarantine facility, which is kind of like a air stream trailer. And, that trailer was brought to Houston and put in the lunar receiving lab which is also in isolation and all the spacecraft and the moon, the materials were put into that. And, they had to stay I that for 21 days from the time they launched from the surface. But, overall Apollo 11 was a great mission built on a lot of work from really hundreds of thousands of people. And, based on Mercury, Gemini, then Apollo.  Gates McFadden: Can I ask a question? A couple. I wanted to know if an astronaut has had some surgery that they have any piece of a metal screw or anything inside, are they, would they be prohibited from doing a mission? Or, the second part of that is what has been the most serious illness that has required some sort of intervention that has happened?  Richard Jennings: You're talking about in space.  Gates McFadden: Yeah.  Richard Jennings: We had, the United States hasn't really had much.  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: We've been lucky. There's a reason, it's not lucky, truthfully, it is somewhat. Things can happen to people. But, for the most part, like, to give an example, let's go back to the Apollo. They have a selection physical which is unbelievable. They have annual physicals. Then, for Apollo, they have physicals, fairly extensive, L minus 30 or F minus 30 they called it back then, 30 days before the mission, 15 days before the mission, 5 days before the mission, and they're really looking at things. Like, we don't carry dental equipment. But, they don't allow any dental restorations for example.  Gates McFadden: They don't okay.  Richard Jennings: And, three months before the flight, because new restorations are the ones most likely to cause problems. We have not had any. We, back to the Apollo program, on Apollo 15 one of the crew members had cardiac dysrhythmia.  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: And, they thought it was due to potassium and it may have been. But, it turns out, this particular person had extensive coronary artery disease. This was before you could do calcium studies or—  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: CT angiograms of coronary vessels. And he had extensive disease and, within two years of the flight he had a cardiac arrest due to a heart attack. The Russians have had some. They've had kidney stones, they've had some things happen. But, in general, we've been extremely lucky.  Gates McFadden: And what do they, like with the kidney stone, what happened, what did they do?  Richard Jennings: Well, you, for men you give them something to make their prostate smaller. You might hydrate them a little, use pain medication.  Gates McFadden: Pain medication.  Richard Jennings: Then you wait.  Gates McFadden: Yeah, yeah, but no one's performed any real surgery.  Richard Jennings: Well, we do on animals some using a glove box. And, it's been practiced in zero gravity and zero gravity airplanes. We've done laparoscopy, we've done cystoscopy, laparotomy, we've done all the things we can do but you did it in 22 second increments not in space.  Gates McFadden: Interesting.  Richard Jennings: Yeah.  Gates McFadden: Thank you.  Host: And so, Gates, kind of, we heard a little bit about what the very beginning of space medicine was like. In your world, that you played in.  Gates McFadden: Yeah Dr. Crusher was much more advanced.  [Laughter]  Host: She was much more advanced.  Gates McFadden: I had quite a few degrees and yeah, right.  Host: Building on the legacy of people like Richard Jennings. But, what are some of the really kind of fantastical technologies that stood out for you that you got to interact with?  Gates McFadden: Well, I loved when, you know, we were replacing spines. And, first of all, the triquarter is just such an amazing machine. And, people have developed the triquarter now, it's not out there, but Xprize actually had from all over the word, teams develop a triquarter. I mean, how fantastic is that? Because to be able to diagnose quickly and to be able to take the readings of everyone's you know what's going on in their body, you would know if someone had the heart arythmic thing. And so, I think there were so many fantastic things that that we were able to do in theoretical, you know, on the spaceship. One of the things that I really found I think about this quite a lot actually, is we had, so we had Data, all right. And he was android, so he's the machine creature. But now, I know that, even in medicine, we put parts of the brain in that can make someone who's had an arm amputated, it can make it so that they can function with a, you know, a new arm that's there, a bionic arm. And, I think about things like privacy and how do you, what happens when..? We haven't really done anything, I don't know, I haven't done it but, in, with the brain where there's some sort of technology where they're trying to deal with something like depression without, and I'm not talking schedules, but literally, you know, you have your own private thoughts. A computer doesn't have their own private thoughts. And pretty soon, you know, it's like what happens when the blend, do we ever get to that point? And, what are the ethical questions about that? And, I'm fascinated by that. I don't know if I'm totally speaking, you know, asking something stupid, but, I'm interested.  Host: Well, I mean, Kris I know you're involved in some of those kind of futuristic technologies. Things like a triquarter might be around the corner in space. I mean, what are some of the things that you’ve seen that you're working on that kind of get you really excited for the next couple decades?  Kris Lehnhardt: It's very fascinating working in NASA and looking at the way that we care for people in space because you would think that we have the newest and greatest technology in space to take care of people. But, what we actually have are things that are very well tested, tried and true things. And, we haven't really been pushing the boundaries of what space medicine or space technology could look like in the future. And, that's because we've been working right now, for the last 20 years on the International Space Station. And, the goal, in terms of medical care for the Space Station is send up extremely healthy people, send up medicine and equipment you could use to manage things, day to day kind of things like aches and pains. But, if you have an emergency, a true emergency, then, there's enough equipment up there to stabilize someone, and then, the plan is to get them home as quickly as you can. And, thankfully, we have not had to do that because, as has been said, we send really healthy people to space. Now, in the future, we're not going to be able to evacuate people, if you are three months on the way to Mars and something bad happens, you are not coming home again. So, what we're working on now, in the future are developing systems that try to allow us provide more capability in space. So, testing out ultrasound machines that are basically the size of my fist and plug into a phone and developing x-ray technology that's extremely small and portable and can be used in space. Or even developing new computer technologies so we can transfer data around and move information better. Right now, we don't store medical data on the Space Station, we send it all to the ground because it's super easy to do that. But, when you have a communication delay, you're going to Mars and it takes 20 minutes for information to move back and forth, sending every little piece of information back and forth is just not efficient. So, how do we manage that on the spacecraft? And then, hopefully, when someone does get sick on the way to Mars, you're going to have a doctor with them who's going to access all that information and all those new technologies and they're going to be able to use those to take care of people in space. And so, that's the ultimate goal.  Gates McFadden: Do you work with cryonics at all, I mean do you work with the idea of getting people like, theoretically, if you're sick and you can't really treat it but you can take their temperature down. Is that something that you all even talk about?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, there is actually a NASA project that is looking at advanced concepts. And, one of the concepts that they're looking at is something like that, they call it TORPOR. And, basically it's the idea of, can I slow down someone's metabolism and essentially preserve them for longer because we've done that? And so, those are concepts that we still look at and we're very interested in, in the future. But, we can't even do that on the ground very well right now. So, NASA doesn't like to fly things into space that we haven't tested ad nauseum on the ground. And so, that one's still many years away.  Gates McFadden: Thank you.  Host: And so, one of my favorite things about Star Trek and a lot of science fiction is actually the myriad of alien disease and things like that we end up running out to on the final frontier. Because, I mean, right now NASA, we're mostly worried about people bringing stuff from Earth, with them, you know? That's why we do the quarantine and stuff, things like that. Gates, what are some of the really memorable, you know, viruses or plagues that you guys had to combat that, you know, really stand out in your mind.  Gates McFadden: Well, of course there was the Naked Now, that makes you just kind of nicely drunk, I guess, that one was always very fun. But, its, and also what that actually brings up is, so if everyone has, is affected by this virus, how does the medical team, in spite of the effects of this virus, figure out, with the computer, what's going on and how to solve it, and how to diagnose it, and then how to treat it? I mean, there were a lot of things like that. And, then, of course, there were invasive things that would take over your mind, and do all that. That's why I think it's fascinating, the psychological aspect of all of it, and how do you deal? I always have admired the astronauts, because, obviously, they're going to be top notch people who are driven, who know how to do their program. And, it's like the people who fly those fighter jets, you know exactly what you're supposed to do so you're not in terror. You're like, I do this, then I do this, then I have to check this, and I work out now, and I do this. And that's fantastic. But, just to be aware of, psychologically, all the things that you, that could be happening. When you said, when you can't see Earth anymore, that was fascinating. Can you talk more about that? Because, to me, that's the reason, I personally want to go into space, is so that I can actually look at Earth and get a new perspective. But once that's not there, what's that like? How do you deal with that?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, so I think, looking at, kind of psychological or behavioral issues that we're going to have to deal with on a long exploration class mission, are huge. I think they've been on the bottom of everybody's priority list, because they're very touchy feely, and hard to discuss, and you don't have distinct treatments for some of these things, but what do you do as Earth becomes smaller, and smaller, and smaller? What do you do when you want to talk to your family, and the time delay gets to the point where you're left with only recorded messages that you send back and forth? You know, for us, in the station, we can see the Earth all the time. We fly over continents very quickly. I can call my husband on his cell phone, pretty much, at any time that I wanted. I had that communication. So, to me, that was very important. I still felt connected to Earth. I had the internet. You know, I could look at the news online. That was important. So, how do we deal with that as we move further and further away? And there are a lot of people looking at these things. But, perhaps we have to go back, kind of, to the old explorers. And I will say that, even during our mission, there was a Soyuz that was supposed to make it up there with two more of our crew mates, and that ship did not make it. It aborted. The crew was safe, because the launch abort system worked perfectly, and saved their lives. But all of the sudden, it was just 3 of us.  Gates McFadden: Right.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: And we though, oh dear, things have changed. Still plenty of work to do, but the entire dynamic changes up there. And, so, we had just watched a movie talking about Ernest Shackleton, and his time with his crew, and how they were stranded for certain parts. And, so, the commander, at the time, of, on board the space station was Alex Gerst, from Germany, and so we decided to do some of those things. We threw a Halloween party. It was just the 3 of us, but you know what, we had a small party, we had costumes, everything.  Gates McFadden: Well, it's creative.   Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Absolutely.  Gates McFadden: And I think, see, I think that's the part, and if I can?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yes.  Gates McFadden: Like, again, it's with Star Trek, because to be creative, you're using parts of your brain, and you are imagining things. And just to engage the imagination, so that it's not only scientific. I mean, obviously, you have to be imagining in order to be scientific. You wouldn't even come up with the idea that you want to prove. But, I think, sometimes it's getting away from it, totally, being out of your comfort zone, that you really can discover something about yourself. And discovering something about myself makes me much more engaged in the world. Like, oh, I didn't realize I would be like that if I were doing this, or whatever. You learn about yourself. You're interested in yourself, and less worried about being interesting. You're interested, you know, in—  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, and I think, one of the things we also did, just because the station is a very sterile environment, right? There are no smells of earth, there's no wind, there's no rain, you had the same people that you're with. And, so, the one way we could make station more human on the inside was music. And I didn't realize how important music, I mean, I listened to music down here, in my car, or wherever, but up there, we had music all the time. And depending on which module you were in, you could be listening to Queen or to Mozart, it just depended on who was working in that module at that time. But that, for me, made the Space Station so much more human, and it just felt like we belonged there, and this was ours.  Host: Well, so, so far we've only had to really worry about a limited number of people in space at any given time. Like, you only have 6 people, typically, 7 sometimes, on board the space station. In the future, we're going to be in situations like Dr. Crusher was, where you have entire star ships worth of people, and entire colonies worth of people, especially as we have commercial companies starting to fly people into space. What do you guys see, kind of, over the horizon, and even, kind of, longer term in the world of space medicine?  Richard Jennings: Well, I'm really excited about commercial space flight, and the commercial crew program. I know how to count seats, and there's a few more seats in those vehicles than just for the astronauts. And, so, we'll be flying some other people. And there'll eventually be free flyers in low Earth orbit, and colonization of Mars. Hopefully we'll become a multiplanetary species. I'm excited about it. Up until now, all the people have been selected, pretty much, by agencies, bureaucracies, that sort of thing. And commercial space flight can be much more agile. Finally, it'll have some nontraditional people flying up. We've had 8 that flew to the International Space Station through Space Adventures. And you have computer experts, you have artists, all different kinds of people, and that's great. We need different people flying in space. One of the other things is that, back to going to the long duration flights, we're going to have to learn how to take care of medical conditions that do develop, like Gates was talking about. We don't have much experience in that. Well, where can we get it? Commercial space flight. Just like I said, you give up your youth and your health to be able to afford one of those flights, and it's a little bit self-serving, for me, because I always have to get these guys approved to fly, but we ought to require that they have something wrong with them. Where else can we learn, unless we do that? And, so, I'm very excited. I'm excited that the numbers are going to increase, that we'll have nontraditional crew members flying. I think the biggest issue will not be medical. It gets back to what you were just discussing, is the psychological aspect. And that's why, I do think, a nice 6 month training program is a good deal. And if there are going to be problems, they'll tend to come out. Most anybody can be on their best behavior for a couple of weeks, but if you put them in a stressful situations, teamwork, over 6 months, if there's a problem, you're going to find out about it. But I'm terribly excited about commercial space flight.  Gates McFadden: One of the, I went to Gene Roddenberry, my first year, I said, can I base a lot of my character on Dr. Oliver Sacks, who was this amazing neurologist. I had read all of his books up to, and he, you know, even now that he's passed, he still has books that'll come out. The most amazing things, because it's all about neurology in the brain, and it's such a burgeoning field, right now, as is radiology, which is enormous. But, it's fascinating, just on earth, all the things the brain does. And when we go up in space, and all that we don't know, and when it changes your entire perspective of the, of the universe, right? Your, my perspective would be completely changed. I'm not looking up like that, I'm looking around, and I'm either seeing nothing, or seeing the Earth small. That has to be profound. That certainly is something that would drive me, should I have the money, ever, to go up into space. I think that would be amazing.  Host: Well, Gates, I'm happy to pool my money with yours, and we can go together.  Gates McFadden: Alright!  Host: We did get—we're going to have to end a little early, so I want to start questions now, if you guys have questions. We have a mic, here, in the center, so if you want, go ahead and line up, and we can start taking some questions for our panel. And if you know who the question is to, just go ahead and ask them.  Audience Member: Well, the first question I have is, are there any plans on cross training? Because right now, I see it as there's just one doctor on the station at a time. What happens if the doctor gets sick?  Host: Good question.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: So, actually, all of the astronauts that fly to the station are trained to, about, the level of a basic EMT. They get training in hospital settings, in ER's, they learn how to suture, they learn how to put in Foley catheters, they are familiar with almost, pretty much every piece of equipment that we have up there. And, in fact, we do joint training's as a crew for, what we call, bad events. We do have a defibrillator up there, as well. And, so, our folks are pretty well trained when they get up there. That being said, you're right, we don't have a doctor with every crew. I wish we did. That would be more flight opportunities for all of us docs out there. But, we rely on the training of the crew, and then the flight surgeons on the ground, who are looking out after us. Now, that's a benefit we have, only being in low Earth orbit, in that we can talk to the docs real time, we can show them live video, they can help us walk through and talk us through anything that might happen. But, yeah, cross training is definitely something we do.  Audience Member: Okay. My daughter is 13 years old. Your show is her favorite show. And you're the one who made her want to be an astronaut. So, my question is, for a 13 year old girl going to high school, and everything, from a small town, what advice would you have for her going forward on a career path line?  Gates McFadden: Is she talking to me?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Both of us I think.  Gates McFadden: Me, both, or which one?  Audience Member: All of you.  Gates McFadden: No, you go ahead.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: What, so my big thing that I would say, because I think this tends to happen with young girls, especially when they're in their early teens is they see something that they're really interested in, but they're afraid to ask about it. Or they see somebody that works and does a really cool job, and they think, that person doesn't have time for me. They're not going to have time to answer my questions. And, so, I really encourage kids to bother, meaning go up and talk to that person, find out what they do, ask if you can spend time with them. And, also, remind them it's okay to change their mind. So, I started off, in my college career, as an engineer, and initially I was just going to continue on with engineering, until friends and outside forces pushed me towards medicine. And, so, I was a little afraid, thinking, wow, can I change my mind right in the middle of college? And it's totally okay to do. It's okay, because you're going to find out what you’re passionate about, and that it's all going to work out just fine. So, give her, though, for me, those two pieces of advice, I'd say, she's going to find something that she's passionate about, and whatever it is, just to stick with it.  Gates McFadden: I will say that I meet, every time I do a convention, I meet so many extraordinary, young women. I mean, really, the kids that come up to the table who are interested and know the show, they are sensational. I am a person who happens to believe that if these children grow up, and they become the people who are, you know, taking care of me in the old age, we're going to be fine. Because they are interested in all sort of things, and I do feel that there's too much pressure, I think, dealing with anxiety and having to do everything. That's the one thing I noticed, more from being a teacher for 35 years on the university level. There's way too much pressure on kids to know what they want to do so young. I mean, if you peak when you're, you know, 7, what are you going to do for the rest of your life? So, I think that, I would advise not to push, expose children to a lot of different things, and see what they are drawn to. And then, if they're drawn to it, then okay, then you can, sort of, guide a little bit more. But I feel having to make decisions of what they're going to do, in their preschool years, is, it's ridiculous. Because I have, some of the best people I've ever taught didn't know what they were doing, and then they suddenly got passionate, and wow. It's because they wanted it. You know? So, I think it's both. It's listening to advice, people say hey, you're really good at this, listening to advice, and speaking up and asking questions. But I think it's also, sometimes, for the parents to just, parents, just love them, you know, just love them. Yeah, great. Great.  Audience Member: All right. So, at the early start of NASA, there was talk about having a limited amount of weight you could have on the flight up. With having the Space Station and everything else, and well you mentioning how important music is, are people, are astronauts able to bring up, now, instruments, or some other personal items to be able to play in space, and just, kind of, let off steam?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah. I mean, we've had several instruments. We have keyboards, we have two guitars, we have a saxophone up there, right now. We had a pan flute, and 3 recorders on my most, on my last, on my mission here. So it was amazing, one of our cosmonauts seemed to pull every musical instrument out of his crew quarters.  Gates McFadden: Fantastic.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: I didn't think it was even possible that he had any more in there, but he did. [laughter] And we would gather, often on Friday and Saturday evenings. Because two of our guys could play guitar, and everybody liked to sing. And we tried to play the recorder, it was awful. [laughter] But it didn't matter. It was something we could do together, as an international crew.  Richard Jennings: On thing I'd mention is that, we're kind of at a changing point, though, with some of the large items on the International Space Station. Our counter measures that we have, the medical counter measures, work great. The resistive exercise device, the treadmills, the bicycle odometers, these sort of things, they work really well, but they're just too big to go to Mars with. So, one of the things we're having to look at, not only the counter measure things, but the enjoyment things that you're talking about, they're going to be much more limited for exploration class type missions. And, so, we're, there's a lot of work going on in that area right now, to get things a little smaller, and what do we really need to support exploration class missions?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, maybe, no guitar, but a ukulele, I guess?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah.  [ Laughter ]  Gates McFadden: They need a holodeck, I think, but that's a ways off. That's how we used to blow off steam, right?  Audience Member: My question involves nutrition, and I know that nutrition is something that's almost in the medical field. But, as important as music is, also good eating is important. So, I was wondering if these long missions to Mars, if the people would have any culinary excitement that they could take with them.  Kris Lehnhardt: We are studying that, right now, at NASA. And I can tell you, it's—food is a real problem for Mars. So, how do you make nutritious food that doesn't spoil, that lasts for more than 3 years. It's really difficult. The other point you brought up, though, is interesting food. And, I'm sure we could make a very unpalatable bar that everyone could eat, every day, all the time.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: I've eaten them.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes. And it's, you don't realize the power of food, I think, until you don't have the variety. And, Serena, I think, can certainly talk about this. When fresh, fresh fruit arrives on a spacecraft, it's pretty magical. We're trying to grow vegetables in space, right now. And, so there's lettuce that we've grown on board, and we're working on other vegetables, as well. But, in the end, we're going to have to do a significant amount of research to find out how we can make the food last, keep it interesting, so we keep the crew healthy. An uninterested crew is not a good crew, psychologically, and they're going to, then, have trouble achieving their mission, and that's our primary objective. So, in the end, nutrition is going to play a more and more important role in space flight, both psychologically and physically.  Audience Member: So, hi. My name's Natalie, and my question was for the people that are medical doctors. So, what do you do when you didn't want to study at all? Personally, right now, I'm still in my premed years. I haven't taken the MCAT yet, and I'm taking organic chemistry soon. So.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Sorry.  Audience Member: Yeah. To be honest, I should be studying right now, instead of being here.  [ Laughter ]  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, so you know, you're going to have those times. Don't get me wrong, I didn't fly through medical school loving every day, and thinking that every class was fantastic, and certainly not organic chemistry. And, so, but what was important to me were the creative things I'd do on the side. What hobbies do you have? I engaged in sports a lot, and martial arts a lot. So, you always have to have things that, kind of, engage the other side of your brain, to give yourself a break. We do the same thing on space station. We work very long hours during the week, and then most of the time we have weekends off to go do things to give ourselves a break. A lot of times, it's photography, it's looking out the window, it's talking to our families and friends. Because when you start to feel that burn out, that stress, what that tells me is you need to take a step back. Because it's not that you don't like what you're doing anymore, but you need to make sure and engage in other things that really let yourself decompress and let your batteries recharge.  Gates McFadden: I mean, I think there's even, I'm not speaking, now, for any astronaut thing, but I have a son who's a violinist, and he, I mean, when, at certain points it was like, you have 100 pages of music you have to learn. And, I mean, it's 9 hours of practice. And he, for years, he almost over practiced. And as he's gotten older, and better and better, he's learned that it's better to just take a step back, do something totally different, even if it's a type 20 minutes, and then you go back to it, and you actually plan how, you get more organized. That he actually is now, spends more time just creating, this is what I have to do in order to get to that concert. And he always plans in the breaks, and when he's, you know, and he actually condenses, now, his practice time, and he sounds better, which is really fabulous. I wish I had known that.  Host: All right. I think we have time for one or two more.  Audience Member: Hi. I've been reading some of the research that's come out from the study of the Kelly Twins, and the mutations from the extended period in space. How are we going to deal with that on the extended time you'd have in space on a mission to Mars?  Gates McFadden: Yeah, it's tough.  Kris Lehnhardt: Thanks for that hard question.  Gates McFadden: Yeah.  [ Laughter ]  Kris Lehnhardt: It's a, it is a real challenge, and I think that one of the things that the Twins Study showed us is that people do come back from space different than they went. And one of the things that we talk about a lot in space medicine is that there's many, many things that happen to us in space that are, we think that they're bad, but they're actually just adaptive processes. And we're getting used to a new environments, and humans are extremely adaptable in that respect. There are other things about the space environment, though, that have a significant negative impact on us, and radiation is one of those. The way that we're going to deal with radiation, right now on the International Space Station, you're still very close to the Earth, and the Earth actually provides you with protection from the radiation of deep space. And, so now, as we push out to the Moon, and on to Mars, we're going to have to deal with that deep space radiation environment. And the way that we're going to do that is through newer, and better technologies. We're going to have to be able to shield spacecraft, as well as possible, to try and prevent the radiation from getting in. But, then, we also know that there's radiation that will pass through any shielding that we have, and that's, in that respect, we have to be able to, then, provide counter measures to the astronauts so that they don't get sick. And those are going to be nutrition based, they may be medicines, as well, exercise may play a role in that. There's many different ways that we might be able to prevent some of those changes. But, at the end of the day, everyone who goes to space comes back different. And we have to accept that, and there is a certain level of risk associated with that. And if the mission is important enough, then the risk is worth it.  Host: All right. We can do one more question.  Audience Member: I married up, didn't I? Gates, I can't think of a single character anywhere in the Star Trek universe with a higher sense of personal integrity than Doctor Beverly Crusher, so I thank you for that portrayal.  Gates McFadden: Thank you, very much.  [ Applause ]  Audience Member: Doctor Auñón-Chancellor, if you could snap your fingers, and live to see your greatest dream, your greatest space exploration dream, living, working in space, what would that be?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: If I could snap my finger, right now, I'd say what I'd love to see would be colonies on Mars, fully functioning, producing our own food, small cities, towns being built, schools being built, and a huge, diverse group of people, with maybe some of the first children being born on Mars, as well. And it may not be as far off as you think, but certainly along with that, I can't see us sticking with current means of rocket technology, and it taking us that long to get there. And those ideas are also being developed. Ion propulsion, how fast, can the trip be much shorter, can you go visit your aunt on Mars? Could that be possible? Absolutely. And push on past Mars. What other planetary services, or bodies, could we land on? So, if I were to think about that, right now, you know, protection of the human really is at the forefront of my mind. Can we keep the humans safe from radiation, and everything else that we've talked about here today? And, at first, all of these problems seem impossible, but every time we seem to overcome them. I mean, people ask me, wasn't it fantastic looking out at the earth? How did your perspective change? And I'd say, sure the earth is beautiful, no question, but what really got me excited, where I really had to stop and say wow, was watching all these vehicles, cargo vehicles pull up, like it was every day business. They'd come out and say, hello station, we're bringing cargo, perform certain maneuvers, and precisely come in and park, just like they're parking in a parking lot. Now, there's a lot more work that goes on behind the scenes for that, but it became so commonplace, and I could see these vehicles just out the window, and I thought, look how far we've come. So, to think that we'll have colonies on Mars, that day's probably coming a lot faster than you think.  Gates McFadden: And I just pray, though, that humanity can, maybe, start to learn from our mistakes, instead of repeat them.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we're going to get, today, so I just want to thank our panel one more time, Gates, Serena, Kris, and Richard, for joining us today.  [ Applause and Cheers ]  And thank all of you beautiful people for being here, as well. I hope you enjoy the rest of Comicpalooza, and go listen to us online, Houston, We Have a Podcast. Thanks.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 159, “Welcome Home Bob and Doug.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have returned to planet Earth. After 64 days in orbit, Behnken and Hurley splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, on the afternoon of August 2nd, 2020, concluding the Demo-2 mission and making history as the first human landing in a commercially built and operated spacecraft. Their mission was to test the capabilities of the new commercial space vehicle, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, for regular transportation of crew to the International Space Station. But they contributed a whole lot more than that on their mission during their 62 days aboard the station, they dedicated more than 100 hours to scientific investigation, working on experiments like droplet formation, electrolysis measurement, and Earth observation. Behnken performed four spacewalks with Station Commander Chris Cassidy to upgrade the station's power system among a number of other items like routing cables and installing robotic storage equipment and is now a record holder for the number of spacewalks and among the top for total hours spacewalking. After landing in the Gulf, they were taken to shore by helicopter and immediately flew back to Houston. There they were greeted by family and VIPs from NASA and SpaceX, all who contributed to the success of the mission. They were able to say a few words before departing for some much-needed rest, but we got to hear from them a few days later for a Q&A. They shared some fascinating details and perspective about their mission. So, on today's podcast, we're going to replay those moments for you here. So, here is a replay of the Welcome Home Ceremony at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas, on August 2nd, 2020, just five hours after splashing down and the Crew News Conference two days later on August 4th. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: In this first segment, hear the words from Doug Hurley then Bob Behnken immediately after landing in Houston. This was followed by some comments from NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and SpaceX CEO and Chief Engineer Elon Musk.  Doug Hurley: Alright. We're not going to stand right now. For those of you who have done this before, you know it's not pleasant standing for a few hours after you get back. Five hours ago, we were bobbing around in the Gulf of Mexico, so I feel like it's pretty good that we got this far in five hours. But I think the biggest thing that we would both like to talk about is just to thank, you know, you can see Steve and Kathy here and Elon. You know, this has been a -- quite an odyssey the last five, six, seven, eight years -- five years since Bob and I started working on this program, and to be where we are now with the first crewed flight of Dragon is just unbelievable. We've said it before, just a tremendous privilege to be part of this program, to be part of NASA and to spend two months on the International Space Station with one of the greatest officers, crewmates, astronauts, Chris Cassidy just was a real pleasure for both of us. And I'm sure Bob will talk about the spacewalks, but just to see those two work out on the International Space Station, you're not going to see anything like that again. It just was -- it was just amazing to be part of that. And then, you know, the flight of Dragon on Falcon and then the reentry today, it's a lot to process. As I said, five hours ago, we were in a spaceship bobbing around making prank satellite phone calls to whoever we could get a hold of, which was kind of fun, by the way. You can send him the bill for the sat phone. But anyway, we really appreciate all of you coming to say hi and welcoming us back. It's a little bit overwhelming to see everybody here considering the things that have gone on the last few months since we've been off planet. But thank you again for coming to say hi, and hopefully, we'll be able to share a lot of this mission with you in a few months, hopefully, if not sooner. But thank you again.  [ Applause]  Bob Behnken: Well, first of all, thank you for everybody who came out today. I know with all the challenges, everybody is wearing a mask, with the situation that we're in, it's not trivial to get this many people here to try to be close and celebrate what we've accomplished. I think for both Doug and I, the thing that we are most excited about having accomplished with this mission is, you know, it's written right on that sign where it says Launch American, and then, of course, Land America today. As we went through our years as astronauts here at the Johnson Space Center, we got to live through a big chunk of the shuttle era and a big chunk of the assembly of the space station. When the space shuttles retired, when Doug took his final flight to wrap that up, I think it was a sad day for us [inaudible] because there's something special about having that capability to launch and bring your own astronauts’ home. And we went through a lot of years without that capability, and I think we are both super, super proud to have been just a small part of the team that accomplished bringing those spaceflights back to the Florida coast and bringing that capability back to America. As Doug mentioned, we had the luxury of having a -- just a super crew onboard the International Space Station with Chris Cassidy, with Anatoly and Ivan. They just took wonderful care of us. I can't think of anything that we could've had more in place and ready for us when we arrived than what Chris set up for us. And so, we are extremely thankful for him and his work to make things look easy for us. You know, we didn't have the full training template that was out there. We had an abbreviated flow and got to take advantage of an opportunity, if you will, to try to take care of space station as we accomplish this test mission. And so, I think we're both really proud of that and happy that it didn't become a distraction. We were able to accomplish the test mission objectives and work through those, kind of get Dragon certified in some sense to be ready for our return home when the time came to do that. And so, it all just worked out wonderfully. And so, today, when we got the wake-up calls from our boys telling us a little bit about what they were looking forward to, which was us coming home, and in Theo's case getting a new dog, it was a wonderful morning, and we very much appreciated it. And so, again, I think this kind of comes full circle. It took years to get here. We brought the capability back to America, and we came home safely to our families. And it took a lot of people a lot of time to make that happen. And so, to Kathy, thank you for that. Of course, you had Steve as your right-hand man for the most recent history at least, and we definitely really appreciate the hard work that you all had to go through to ensure that the contractors in this case, on the SpaceX team really could understand NASA and what we needed to be able to have in place to have human spaceflight be safe in the way that we wanted to operate it. And I think for the SpaceX team, we couldn't have asked for a more wonderful team to work with. I think, you know, we definitely are old dogs and like some of our old tricks because -- it's not always because lazy. Sometimes it is because we did it before and we know an easy solution, and we try to share that with folks, and that's really -- as we go forward to further activities, whether it's in low-Earth orbit, to the Moon, or beyond, we need to figure out the best way to share what NASA knows with a contractor team and help them be as successful as possible. And I think maybe we weren't there five or six years ago, of course, but by the time we launched, and certainly by the time we returned, I think there was a very tight-knit relationship between the SpaceX team and our NASA team, and we work together to accomplish what we accomplished. So, with that, I just want to thank you all for coming out today and celebrating this victory with Doug and I and recognize our small part of what was accomplished. Thank you all.  [ Applause]  Jim Bridenstine: I've been told I'm not allowed to hold the microphone, and that's really hard for me to do. But I'm going to take my mask off for just a few seconds here and just say thank you to everybody who participated in this. You know, we just saw Bob and Doug, and I think all of us are going to have memories now for the rest of our lives when they launched. In fact, we'll have memories of the day that they didn't launch, and then three days later coming back and doing the whole thing again, not knowing whether or not they were going to go 50/50 on the weather, and then, sure enough, the skies opened up, and we were able to launch Bob and Doug. I want to say a few words just about what champions they are beyond just being the first crew to fly on Dragon. It goes beyond that. They knew that when they were doing this, it was a test flight. They also knew that they were going to be responsible for, you know, conducting a lot of operations on the International Space Station for a period of months to include what ended up being four spacewalks, spending that extended period of time on the International Space Station, and then flying back and amazingly coming off the jet just right now after being weightless for the last 63 days, coming off the jet, sitting down, and doing a public event. And I got to tell you, I've never flown into space, but from my -- that's not normally done. It's very difficult. But they wanted to take that opportunity to connect with the American people on this momentous occasion. And I can't say how -- you just can't put into words how important this was for our country to have access to space again from our own soil. So, again, I know they left, but congratulations to Bob and Doug and their families. What an amazing day for the United States of America. I would also say that what we just saw is the beginning of what will be a whole lot more activity in the future. Right now, when we talk about commercial crew, we're going to go, for the Dragon, we're going to go from development into operations. Of course, we're always going to learn, and we're always going to modify, but making that transition from development to operations is going to be a challenge, but the NASA team is up for it. But it goes beyond that because we still have Starliner, and we need to get Starliner flying, and then we've got to get Orion flying. And we've got to get Starship flying. And we've got to get -- what's that?  Unknown speaker: [Inaudible] a lot of stars.  Jim Bridenstine: A lot of stars -- absolutely. So, look, there is a lot to do in front of us. But here's what we know. We know that when members of Congress come together in a bipartisan way and they fund NASA, amazing things can happen. Right now, we have before the House and the Senate the biggest budget request in NASA's history in nominal dollars. By the way, right now, we have the biggest budget NASA has ever had in nominal dollars. Now, if you look at real dollars, Apollo might have us beat by a little bit, but we're heading the right direction. And next year, if we get the budget request that is before us right now next year, we are going to go up in order of magnitude, and that is necessary because today we're flying into low-Earth orbit, and in a few short years, we want to be flying to the Moon. And not just go once or twice, but we want to go sustainably with a purpose. We're going to the Moon sustainably. We're going to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time. We're going to use the resources of the Moon in order to live and work, and we're going to take all of that knowledge onto Mars. That's what we're able to accomplish because of the bipartisan support we've had in the House and in the Senate for the budget that we have right now. And what I'm asking for our members of Congress to do is look at what we've done with what we have, and if you fund us at our budget request level, we will be on the Moon, and we will be successfully on the Moon with our commercial partners and with our international partners. So today was an amazing day. It was a historic day. It's been nine years since America launched and landed from its own soil. And yet here we are. And the next step is we're going on to the Moon and then onto Mars. This is about momentum. It starts today, and it finishes when we put an American flag on Mars. Alright. I've got the honor to introduce somebody who we are very grateful for to help us accomplish this mission. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, NASA seeks to be one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low-Earth orbit. And we want to have numerous providers that compete on cost and innovation and safety. And I will tell you, there was a moment maybe not even a year ago, Kathy Lueders, you can tell me how long ago it was when we had some significant challenges. We might have had a few disagreements on parachutes. We might have had maybe a disagreement on, you know, maybe we need to change the titanium because of its reactivity with nitrogen tetroxide, and I sent a tweet, Elon, and I know you remember this, and since we've had a number of dialogues, I sent a tweet, and I said that it's time to deliver, and I tweeted it at Elon Musk. And I want to tell you, Elon, you responded absolutely magnificently, and you have, in fact, delivered. You have delivered beyond anything any of us would have expected. And I will also say that all of the reports I am getting from all of the teams on commercial crew is that this mission went as good as we could have hoped. And we are so grateful for the team at SpaceX, the great team at NASA's Commercial Crew Program, and all of the operators that helped us to get to this point. So, I just want to say thank you, Elon Musk. The time is yours.  [ Applause]  Elon Musk: Woohoo! Yeah! Thanks, Jim. That -- I mean after these great words that were spoken, I am not sure I have much to add from, you know, Bob and Doug and Jim. But I do think what this heralds really is fundamentally a new era in spaceflight, a new era in space exploration. We're going to go to the Moon. We're going to have a base on the Moon. We're going to have -- send people to Mars and make life multi-planetary. And I think this day heralds a new age of space exploration. That's what it's all about. And this is the result of an incredible amount of work from people at SpaceX, people at NASA.  Hey, Kathy! Hey -- I mean, so much -- 18 years. This has been 18 years to finally fly people to orbit and back. And I really came here because I just wanted to see Bob and Doug to be totally frank. It was like, oh, thank goodness! I think like my entire adrenaline was just dumped, you know. It was like, thank God! Phew! You know? I'm not very religious, but I prayed for this one. So just once again, thanks, everyone at SpaceX, NASA, FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] -- everyone, Air Force, you know, that played a role in this, and key suppliers that did incredible work. Thanks again. And, you know, I think this is something that the whole world can take some pleasure in and can really look at this as an achievement of humanity. And this -- these are difficult times when, you know, there's not that much good news. And I think this is one of those things that is universally good, no matter where you are on planet Earth, this is a good thing. And I hope it brightens your day. Thank you.  [ Applause]  Host: Next, here is the news conference with Behnken and Hurley that occurred two days later. This was the first chance after splashdown for anyone to ask questions to them. So, you will hear the questions that were asked in real-time while I moderated the conference. The crew answers quite a number of them and does a great job of describing riding on Dragon and life aboard station. So, here we go starting with initial remarks from Doug Hurley.  Doug Hurley: Well, it's great to talk to you today. We're just a couple days removed from splashdown off the coast of Florida near Pensacola. Excited to be back. We're already working through our exercise and rehabilitation program to kind of get our Earth legs back. We were lucky that we worked out pretty hard on space station, and I think we've both done pretty well up to this point. We're also lucky in the fact that we landed in some pretty smooth waters thanks to the weather folks, and so I think that helped a lot. Just incredibly excited to be back. Incredibly excited to share the mission with all of you in another way. And just so proud of the SpaceX and NASA teams to get Dragon through its first crewed flight flawlessly. Just -- we're almost kind of speechless as far as how well the vehicle did and how well the mission went and all the things we did onboard ISS with Chris Cassidy and Anatoly and Ivan. So just glad to be back, and it's great to see how excited everybody was for our mission and followed along, and we hope it brings a little bit of brightness to a pretty tough 2020.  Host: Thank you, Doug. We'll now hand it over to Bob Behnken.  Bob Behnken: I think Doug pretty much covered most of the things that either one of us would say about the mission itself. I would just add that, you know, it's a humbling experience to be a part of what was accomplished with the SpaceX vehicle, just a wonderful team on the NASA side and the SpaceX side to pull it all off. It took years in the making. I think Doug and I have been working at it for a good solid five years to get to this point, and it's just awesome to kind of see it to fruition. I know that one of the things that we're most proud of is bringing launch capability back to the Florida coast, back to America, and, of course, landing safely at the end of all of that, and so just, again, humbled to be a part of such an awesome team and awed by what they accomplished.  Host: Thanks to you both for those initial remarks. We'll now open it up for questions. Let's start on our phone bridge first with Loren Grush from “The Verge.”  Loren Grush: Hi, Bob and Doug. Good to talk to you. And congratulations on such a great launch. Leading up to this mission, the date of the launch was always so uncertain, and you mentioned you had planned your life in increments of weeks or months at a time, so I'm wondering how does it feel now after all that build up now that it's over and you have a little more certainty in your schedule again? Thanks.  Doug Hurley: Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know if certainty is the right word at this point. You know, I think for both of us, it still feels pretty surreal. And I know that's a little bit overused, but I don't know how else to describe it. You know, one moment you're bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico, and, you know, less than two days later, you're in a news conference. So, you know, it has been a time to reflect and think about a lot of the things that went on and the lead up to the mission, the mission itself, you know, the launch, the on-orbit time, the entry, the landing, but, yeah, at least we know we're done with the mission, which, you know, we didn't even really know launch dates until just a few months before we launched, and we didn't know the duration of the mission until a few weeks before we came home, and so I guess it's nice in that respect to be back with our family and our friends here at NASA and working through the post-flight activities that we have, and they are pretty well scheduled for the next few weeks for sure. In fact, there's a lot of stuff to do over the next few weeks. So we're hoping at some point just to take some time off and share a little more time with our family since they are the ones that really had to sacrifice over the, as Bob said, over the last five years because we were mostly in California, and we were mostly obviously the last two months in space.  Host: Next, we'll go to Andrea Leinfelder from the “Houston Chronicle.”  Andrea Leinfelder: Thanks, welcome home. Bob, you gave a really great description of what it was like to launch in the Crew Dragon. I was hoping you could give us a similarly vivid account of what it was like to land. Thank you.  Bob Behnken: Well, thank you, Andrea. You know, the landing was -- I would say it was more than what Doug and I expected. Things are always pretty smooth as you work through a deorbit burn because, of course, you are still in low-Earth orbit while you take that little bit energy out that it takes to lower you into the atmosphere and start the trip home. As we kind of descended through the atmosphere, I personally was surprised at just how quickly it all -- the events all transpired. It seemed like just a couple minutes later, after the burn was complete, we could look out the windows and see the clouds rushing by at a much-accelerated rate. You know, one of the things we didn't have a lot of time to do during our time dock to station with how busy we were is to really focus on the Earth for an extended period of time, and during free flight in Dragon we were able to do that, and probably had a pretty good feel for the rate that the Earth was moving below us, and we could definitely tell things were picking up quick after we started that burn. Once we descended a little bit into the atmosphere, you know, Dragon really -- it came alive. It started to fire thrusters and keep us pointed in the appropriate direction. The atmosphere starts to make noise. You can hear that rumble outside the vehicle, and as the vehicle tries to control, you feel a little bit of that shimmy in your body, and our bodies were much better attuned to the environment. So, we could feel those small rolls and pitches and yaws, and all those little motions were things that we picked up on inside the vehicle. As we descended through the atmosphere, the thrusters were firing almost continuously. And I think just the sound that that makes, I did record some audio of it, but it doesn't sound like a machine. It sounds like an animal coming through the atmosphere with all that -- all the puffs that are happening from the thrusters and the atmospheric noise, it just continues to gain magnitude as you descend down through the atmosphere, and I think we both really, really noticed that aspect of things. All the separation events from the trunk separation through the parachute firings were very much like getting hit in the back of the chair with a baseball bat. You know, just a crack, and then you'd get some sort of a motion associated with that. Usually pretty light for the trunk separation, but with the parachutes, it was a pretty significant jolt. And a couple jolts as you go through the dis-reefing of the parachutes as well. And so, all the way down, we were talking about it. I think I took a line from an old movie that Doug and I were both familiar with at one point because, under the g-load of about 4.2 gs, I said, \"Want to get some coffee?\" You know, much like we had seen in an old movie that we had watched because that we really the feeling that we had, and that's the best way to describe it. If you've seen an old movie that happened to have some guys who had been in a centrifuge, that's what we felt like. When the time came to splashdown, I think we were watching the altimeter, which is a GPS altimeter, so it's not super accurate everywhere that you are located, and so we got to below zero for our altitude on that indicator, which was a little bit surprising, and then we felt the splash, and we saw it splash up over the windows. It was just a great relief, I think, for both of us at that point. And I can't say enough at about how well the SpaceX team trained us. You know, they provided us some audio clips of what it was like inside the Demo-1 vehicle so that we were familiar with all those sounds and reassuring is not quite the right word because we think of it more in technical terms as, you know, pilots and engineers riding along with that vehicle, but when it performed as expected, and we could check off those events, we were really, really comfortable coming through the atmosphere even though, you know, it felt like we were inside of an animal.  Host: Let's go to David Kerley from the “Discovery Channel.”  David Kerley: Wow, Bob, what a description. Welcome back to both of you. I have a lot of technical questions, but let's do the fun question and the big question. Bob, did you leave something for Megan? You don't have to tell me what it is. Will SpaceX leave it there? And, Doug, you said you would talk about the historical meaning afterwards. Here we are. Big picture -- what does this mean? Thank you, gentlemen, and welcome home.  Bob Behnken: Well, inside the vehicle, you know, it's not something we don't do is leave things behind. We do our best to, you know, keep it in ship shape. We did leave a patch inside the vehicle. There's a Demo-1 sticker that we added, and we did give the ship a name, Endeavor, and I'm hopeful that they will be able to keep both of those things as they go forward and add their decal to the interior of Endeavor.  Doug Hurley: I guess for me from the historical aspect, I think certainly the first U.S. crewed vehicle since the shuttle, so nine years ago. Certainly, personally, it is significant because I was the last shuttle pilot and then the first commander of Dragon, and so that's -- it's neat to think about now. You know, and I certainly maybe a year from now will think a lot more about it, but I'm more -- I think what is more important to me is the historical aspect for NASA and certainly for SpaceX. It just -- for a company that has only been around for a decade or a little more than that to build a spaceship that takes crew into orbit and returns them safely, just that part of the historical aspect for me is probably most significant. It's just -- and to be part of that, for me, is also by far the most important and one of the most incredible highlights that I'll have from a professional career to just share in that journey, that odyssey, that Endeavor as we named our ship was just one of the true honors of my entire life but certainly my professional career.  Host: We'll now go to Marcia Dunn from “Associated Press.”  Marcia Dunn: Hi. I'm wondering, did either of you realize real-time that you were surrounded by pleasure boats filled with gawkers so soon after splashdown? And if so, were you concerned? And if you were unaware of them, were you surprised to find that out afterward? And, Bob, a real quick question, when is the puppy arriving?  Doug Hurley: Well, I guess since Bob has got a really important question to answer, I'll talk about the boaters. You know this is something that we discussed as a NASA, SpaceX group prior to Demo-1, actually. And, you know, we certainly appreciate the folks wanting to participate in the event. But, you know, there's some safety aspects that I think, you know, as the administrator said we'll have to take a look at because it just can't happen like it did before, but certainly, we were not -- and it's mostly due to kind of the way the windows looked after splashdown, so, you know, the reentry is a fairly dynamic event, and you can see from, you know, just an overall view of the capsule that reentry is a pretty demanding environment, you know, with the different scorches on the vehicle. And the windows were not spared any of that -- to look out the windows, you could basically tell that it was daylight but very little out. So we didn't really see anything clearly out the windows until the SpaceX recovery crews got near us with the fast boats, and then we could see a head or two out the window, but, yeah, I had absolutely no awareness of the other flotilla that was out there until we were back onboard GO Searcher and in the medical facility.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, I just would add a little bit to that, which is folks need to realize we were delayed with actually opening the hatch for an extended period while the teams really made sure that everything was clear and that the vehicle was safe for us to exit and for them to get as many people as required to, you know, perform that extraction for us. And so just a word to the wise for folks who have ideas of coming that close again in the future that we take extreme precautions to make sure it is safe, and we do that for a reason, and hopefully they'll appreciate that, you know, that's required really with us required with spacecraft operations. As far as the puppy goes, we're on about a two-week time frame where we'll -- we need to teach my son a little bit about the things that are required to, you know, have a dog in the house and make sure he's comfortable with picking up his responsibilities associated with the dog. You know, I've done a lot of that with the IP [internet protocol] phone from the space station over the last couple months, but now he has got to put his work in to get the dog bed in the right location and show me that he's ready to take on that responsibility. And, you know, he's going to love that puppy, and he's going to -- and he needs to bring him upright, and so we're going to set him up for success. Otherwise, it'll be my dog instead of his.  Host: Let's go to Robert Pearlman from “collectSPACE.”  Robert Pearlman: Hi, Bob and Doug. Great to see you back on Earth. Up until now after a historic NASA first flight like yours, it would almost be a given that something from the mission, the spacecraft or the spacesuits would be headed to the Smithsonian, but given the commercial nature of your flight, very little of your mission's equipment belongs to NASA, and your spacecraft is already slated to fly again, so were it up to you, what would you like to see SpaceX donate to the National Air and Space Museum or otherwise put on public display? And might we see your sons agree to donate Tremor?  Bob Behnken: Well, they might make that agreement. I'm sure they would request something in trade. I don't know. At least an opportunity to go see where Tremor's new home would actually be. I think there's a lot of Tremors out there as well at this point, and so I think it could be that the marketplace is saturated with Tremors. As far as what I would like to see donated, you know, I still think there's an opportunity for the history to play out and this capsule to still end up in the Smithsonian. You know, it could be used and reused, and then find that permanent home. SpaceX has done a wonderful job. If you've ever visited or seen pictures inside the facility there in Hawthorne, they do have hardware that they've flown or hardware that they've tested and managed to put on public display. Right here, we do have a -- here in Houston at the Space Center Houston, they do have a first stage now that was used, and it's nice to have that in full public view. And I'm sure and confident that they are going to share pieces of the hardware with the public at large. You know, if you go out to Hawthorne, there's a first stage sitting right there on the corner of the property line there, and it's just awesome for people to see that hardware and be able to, you know, recognize it as hardware that was used for space missions, and, you know, take a picture next to it and be a part of it. And so, I know they'll do it. And if it was up to me, I think all of this hardware has a home someplace in the future when it's used up. It's just not used up yet.  Host: Thank you. We're now going to switch to social media for just a second. First of all, you have folks from all over the world on Twitter and Facebook saying hello and congratulations -- Brazil, England, Canada, Argentina, the Netherlands, all over the U.S., just to name a few, but this seems to be a common theme. This one is from Shanika. “Who gets to keep Tremor?”  Doug Hurley: Well, I think we're probably going to go along the lines of I believe it's the NHL where the team that wins the Stanley Cup if you're familiar with that, each member of the team gets to have the Stanley Cup for a day or two, and I think we'll probably work out something along those lines where we just have a, you know, he spends some time at Bob's place, and then he spends some time at our place. And, you know, I think that's fair. And then I think at some point obviously the boys will, you know, they're going to grow up and potentially outgrow Tremor, and, you know, we'll figure out a good, a good place for Tremor as well, just like hopefully with the Endeavor and our suits and anything else that was associated with this mission. It's just a neat memory for Bob and I as fathers, you know, to share this type of thing with our sons, and we're just thankful that we were allowed to take Tremor with us, and it's frankly just amazing to see the response to Tremor and how much people enjoyed that part of the mission along with some of the other things. So, we really appreciate that and thank folks for understanding, you know, that it was important to us.  Host: We'll take one more AskNASA question. This one from Leanne on Facebook asking, “what's the first thing you ate after returning to Earth?”  Bob Behnken: I think for both of us, the first thing we ate was the pizza that they had available on the jet that brought us back into Houston. So, we had a good pizza. We, you know, we've done a lot of travel on the aircraft operation folks here at Johnson Space Center's aircraft over the last 20 years frankly whether it was T-38s or as we responded to COVID and used the larger airplanes to help us get from place to place from a training perspective, and they always have a good plan for taking care of the crews that are onboard and our landing day was no different than the other days. They had us all hooked up and set up, and the pizza was waiting when we made it onboard.  Host: Thank you. We'll now turn to the phone bridge, starting with Eric Berger from “Ars Technica.”  Eric Berger: Hi, guys. I want to congratulate on your excellent timing. Houston in August is lovely. If I may ask a non-Tremor question, were there any surprises during the mission? It all looked so smooth from the launch to the landing, you know, to us watching on the ground. And was it really that perfect? Like did the vehicle perform that well, or was there anything that happened like maybe you went in the capsule on-orbit, and there was a funny odor? Or, you know, something that alarmed you during the two months you were up there? Or was it all just that smooth? Thank you.  Doug Hurley: Frankly, the DM-2 mission part of it as well as the docked ISS mission that we participated in, Expedition 63, but certainly the DM-2 mission, I personally expected there to be more, you know, certainly not issues with the vehicle, but some challenges or some things that were maybe not quite what we expected, I mean even on our shuttle flights, we had things that happened on both of mine, and I know, you know, Bob and I have talked a lot about his missions as well. There were things that happened that were right out of a simulator event and something that you certainly wouldn't have expected in a real flight, but my credit, once again, is to the folks at SpaceX, the production folks, the people that put Endeavor together, and then certainly our training folks, the mission went just like the simulators, and I -- honestly from start to finish, all the way, there was really no surprises, and I think for me personally, I expected the entry to diverge somewhat by what we saw in the simulator, and what I mean by that is as a capsule gets in the thicker air of the atmosphere, so somewhere around 20K, down to maybe 10K, just prior to the drogues with Dragon, I expected there to be some divergence in attitude control because it's a real tough problem for the ship as it gets into the thicker air to maintain perfect attitude and control. And at some point, and then the design of this vehicle is for the drogues to come out potentially a little bit earlier than they nominally would come out to kind of right the vehicle. I fully expected that to happen, and it did not. The vehicle was rock solid right up until the nominal drogue deploy altitude, and as Bob described, you could feel it, you knew exactly, you felt the decel[eration], you knew the drogues both worked, and then it was the same with the mains. We felt the different stages of disreef, and right to the impact in the water, it was, you know, we kind of had a feeling it would be not as much as a Soyuz landing as it was described to us, but it was going to be a pretty firm splashdown, and then, you know, how we bobbed -- even how we bobbed in the water and how the vehicle sat in the water. So, my compliments to SpaceX and the Commercial Crew program. The vehicle performed exactly how it was supposed to. And you feel really good about Crew-1 and what they should expect and what they should see when they fly their mission.  Host: Next is Chris Davenport from “The Washington Post.”  Chris Davenport: Oh, hey, guys. Welcome back. Good to see you. Two quick ones. Just looking for maybe, Bob, a description of what it was like inside Dragon when the heat was building, and that plasma was building. Were you cool? What the view was like? And then maybe, Doug, if you could talk about how many calls you made on the sat phone and who you called? Thanks, bye.  Bob Behnken: You know, as we came through the atmosphere, I think we had a pretty good view out the window until the gs started building, at least for me. My focus kind of shifted towards the display content, and the windows are down by our feet, and so being able to look at those requires kind of head motion and pushing your body around and so just didn't seem like the smartest thing to do, you know, as the vehicle was maneuvering and starting to put gs on to be turning our heads and trying to move around in the seats. At that point, we were trying to make sure that we were good and strapped in. I do feel like I felt some warming of the capsule on the inside, and so the real notice was that when I did get a chance once the gs had come down to look out those windows again, you know, they were obscured as Doug described earlier, and so we kind of saw the clouds racing by and then the g-load started to build up, and we focused on, you know, monitoring the vehicle and paying attention to those small bobbles that we could feel as it controlled the attitude, and then there was not much to see out the windows by the time we had another chance to do it. So --  Doug Hurley: Yeah. And I think -- I'll just add, I had an entry that was a night entry and then a day entry, and it's tough with shuttle even to see the plasma in the daytime. It's almost just this really thin pinkish hue that you could -- in the front seats of the shuttle, you could pick up just very -- it was very difficult to see. So I certainly didn't expect with a full daytime entry like we had with Dragon and then as Bob described the position of the windows relative to where we sit until the seats adjust for the -- basically to get our heads more vertical than our feet after we're under parachutes, you really have to work pretty hard to just see out the windows. And as far as the sat phone, yeah, that probably was a pretty funny to hear that you have astronauts calling whoever we can call. But there was a real reason for it. You know, Nick Hague, when he had his abort onboard Soyuz, they also have a phone where they're able to call folks, but some of the numbers either weren't correct or weren't loaded. And as I think most people know, in this day and age, we know very few phone numbers by heart like we used to know many years ago, and so we wanted to get a test objective out of the way, which was to call the core station at Hawthorne and when we called to say, \"Hey, we would like to do that,\" they said, \"Stand by.\" And so, we decided we would exercise our judgment and use the phone to call some other folks. So, we called Anthony I think at the CAPCOM console -- or at the flight director console here. And, you know, \"Hi, this is Bob and Doug. We're in the ocean.\" And then we also called our wives who happened to be together. I think they were here at mission control, and, of course, they were excited. And as all folks know that have gone through this as a family member, you are kind of helpless until you hear the voice of your loved one on the other end, and this was a great chance to reassure them that we were in the water, we were OK, we were feeling good, and then at that point we were still waiting on SpaceX, and so we just decided to call a few other people that we knew their phone numbers to. And we got a hold of a few, but if anybody has ever used a sat phone, sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't connect. So, it was a -- but it was a very successful test, and we're confident that future crews if they need it, it's a good option for communication.  Host: Next is Stephen Clark from “Spaceflight Now.”  Stephen Clark: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a successful mission, and welcome back to Earth. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, you know, this by all accounts was a very successful test flight. Just based on your experiences, can I get one of you to comment on if you think Crew Dragon is ready to go for crew rotation missions to the ISS with your successful return? Thanks.  Bob Behnken: You know, I think both of us are in agreement, no questions, that the Crew Dragon, once they finish the certification process, you know, they do need to look at the data from our entry. You know, it's not just the end-user’s anecdotes of how well it performed. They will do a very thorough review both on the SpaceX side and the NASA side to make sure that they're comfortable. But from a crew perspective, I think that it is definitely ready to go. There are things that can be improved, just like even with the final flight of the space shuttle. I know Doug will tell you that there are things that could have been improved or would have been improved if we flew a 136. And so there will be some things that we'll have some ideas about how we could make better to make things a little bit more comfortable or a little bit more efficient inside the vehicle for those crews, but from a crew perspective, I think we're perfectly comfortable saying that Crew-1 is ready when they finish the engineering and analysis associated with certification.  Doug Hurley: One thing I would just like to add about that, you know, Bob and I talked many times over the last couple of years about the duration of the flight, and for a long part of that until just, you know, the -- essentially the beginning of this year, you know, it was going to be the same length as the DM-1 flight, so just a few days in space. And I think, I personally feel a lot better even though there were some challenges dealing with the, you know, the duration of the flight and when all that would come together, I certainly feel much better from the Crew-1 perspective and subsequent flights of having Dragon docked to station for two months is a much better outcome for me than if we had just been up there a few days. If you're asking the Crew-1 folks to be up there for a full up six-month ish-type duration, I think they should have a lot more confidence that the vehicle does fine in the quiescent mode, dock to station, and there wasn't anything that maybe wouldn't have been uncovered had we just been up there for just a few days, so and I thought that was a much better outcome.  Host: We have Gina Sunseri from “ABC News.”  Gina Sunseri: What mission would be on the books for you both next? What would you like to do?  Bob Behnken: At least for me, I think in the short-term is, I transition to a support role. As you know, my wife is assigned to a SpaceX mission, and we have a young son, and so I'll definitely be focused on making sure that her mission is as successful as possible and supporting her just as she did for me over the last five years with the uncertainty in our launch dates and uncertainty in our return dates, it's definitely her turn to focus on getting her mission accomplished while I take care of the things that need to be taken care of for our home life.  Host: Next is Elizabeth Howell from “Space.com.”  Elizabeth Howell: Welcome home. And I wanted to know what kind of lessons learned or kind of advice that you would be giving to the Crew-1 when they get ready to go?  Doug Hurley: That's a great question, and, you know, we have a tag up with those guys I believe early next week, and I think we've mentioned before that we talked to them shortly after launch and once we were docked just to kind of while it was all fresh in our memories, a data relay to all the things that we noticed or saw, sounds, things that really can't be emulated very well in a simulator and things that would trigger, you know, any of the other training objectives that they are going through right now as they wrap up their training. And so, I think lessons learned, you know, there are always lessons learned. You know, things that we did that maybe we could be more efficient about or that we learned or that we thought maybe would work one way or that maybe would work better for another. But generally speaking, I think it's more just relaying the experience and what we did in those particular situations and also trying to at least imagine what it would have been like to have four people in the vehicle rather than two. And we did some docked operation evaluations with four people, and, you know, we had Anatoly and Chris act as the other two crew members, and their vast experience in flying Soyuz and spaceflight in general, they had some great suggestions, and we, at the time, pass those things on in the debrief, and we'll definitely talk to the Crew-1 folks about that as well. But, yeah, there's a very formal process and then an informal process, and we'll just try to pass on everything that we've learned and what we think might work the best with a crew of four.  Host: We have Joey Roulette from “Reuters.”  Joey Roulette: Thanks for doing this. And, Bob, I really appreciate that description of descending in Crew Dragon you gave earlier in the call, and I was wondering, do you think there's anything SpaceX can or should do to make Crew Dragon's descent calmer, or is that the way it should be? And is that what you expected? Thanks.  Bob Behnken: I think from a crew perspective, you know, really, what is important is that you understand the events that the vehicle is going to go through and know what to expect. And so the thing that I found most valuable having gone through that experience was something that actually the launch team put together for us, pulled together some ascent video from both Demo-1 and the abort test that they performed to show what the sounds in Dragon were synced up with the video feed. And so being able to watch that and hear the sounds and see what they corresponded to on the video from, you know, the outside tracking cameras that were in place was just invaluable from my perspective and really understanding what the vehicle was going to be going through and be comfortable as we went through it and monitor it appropriately. And so, you know, both Doug and I had confidence like we described earlier that, you know, the drogues had come out, and that the reefing had happened according to schedule just based on being able to watch that video and hear the sounds and have it all synced up. We just knew what to expect. You know, this maybe sounds a little bit boring, and I'm going to get probably some flak from talking about movie clichés again, but, you know, there's a movie “Groundhog Day,” where they're sequencing through and everything is predictable, and for dynamic events like a spaceflight for ascent and for entry, it really is invaluable as you try to control your body and come through that environment whether it's a g-loading or it is the dynamics of a pitch, yaw, and roll moving you around inside the vehicle, knowing what to expect really sets you up for success to work your way through it and do anything that you might need to do in those dynamic situations, and I think that video that the SpaceX team put together was just wonderful, and I watched it again on orbit before we came home, and I know that will be in our list of things that we recommend to the Crew-1 guys if they haven't already watched it that that's something that they should kind of commit to memory and consider even having available on orbit.  Host: Next is Morgan McFall from “Business Insider.”  Morgan McFall: Hi, Bob and Doug. Welcome home, and thanks so much for taking my question. I'm wondering what you would most like to see for the partnership between NASA and SpaceX going forward, and what are you most excited about in this new era of human spaceflight? Thank you.  Doug Hurley: Well, it is neat to see SpaceX is in the competition to build the lunar lander with two other companies. And we've had, as an agency, we've had a wonderful partnership with SpaceX, you know, from commercial cargo to commercial crew, and they just continue to work towards the goal of getting humanity out into the cosmos, and it's been a great relationship. It has been very beneficial for both SpaceX and for NASA, and this, once again, the success of DM-2 proves that it should be something that we should continue, and I am excited to see that happen. It was a lot of work to get from where we started five years ago to now, but it is just -- they are a wonderful company to work with, and they have some incredibly talented people, and I think there is plenty to come from the relationship that NASA and SpaceX have.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, from my perspective, it really is critical that we continue to try to build on that relationship that Doug has referred to. You know, it won't be appropriate if we take the next step, which is to restart with a different NASA team and a different SpaceX team. We really need to leverage those relationships and continue with all the, you know, the five years of experience that we have of figuring out the things that NASA can best share with SpaceX to make them as successful as quickly as possible, and, you know, that applies to all the partnerships that NASA sets up is figuring out the best way to communicate and share information is how we're going to all cooperate to get to our end objective. And so, I just am really excited as we go forward that the relationships and the work that's -- the groundwork that is in place is going to be leveraged to accomplish even more great things in the future.  Host: We'll take one from Mark Carreau from “Aviation Week.”  Mark Carreau: Wondering what the primary question you're getting from your astronaut colleagues is and what you're telling them about the experience?  Doug Hurley: Actually, we haven't had a ton of interaction with anybody given that, you know, when you get back from space you have a pretty compromised immune system to some degree, so we're taking every precaution that we can to try to stay away from most folks although there is a lot of medical testing and rehabilitation that's going on, but there will be time to do debriefs, and I think, as I mentioned before, certainly with the Crew-1 folks coming up here pretty shortly, but, yeah, we haven't seen a lot of them because, you know, we're just in the stage of the pandemic where we're still I think-- even the folks that are -- haven't gone to space are trying to distance and wear masks and those kinds of things, but we definitely know that there are a lot of questions. We have certainly gotten a lot of texts and emails, and hopefully, we can describe everything from memory that is pertinent. And as Bob said, you know, SpaceX will certainly have a synced-up video with audio for our ascent as well as our entry that will be passed on for multiple crews for them to use.  Bob Behnken: I would say we are still the phase where all of our astronaut colleagues aren't asking us for information. They know now is not the time for that. They're asking us do we need anything, are our families well taken care of, are we in good shape, and so that's their primary focus right now is, you know, taking care of the team, which is the astronaut office, and so I -- all the well wishes that come in are, \"Do you need anything?\" \"Is there -- don't climb a ladder. I'll change the light at your house.\" All those sorts of things and it has just been wonderful how many folks have reached out to try to, you know, make sure that we're well taken care of after the mission that we just went through. And it's like that for every mission when crews come back.  Host: We'll now go to social media for a few more questions there using hashtag #AskNASA. This one comes from Natalie on Twitter. “What is the reconditioning process like to get reacquainted with gravity?”  Doug Hurley: Well, we'll spend two hours every day with our strength and conditioning specialists. And it is essentially just a walk before you run literally type process. We do some stretching. We do some aerobic exercise. We do some lifting and some agility drills. And it's -- you're pretty tired after the two-hour process, and we just started it yesterday, so on Day 2, and it will continue for roughly 45 days. And most people really adjust in that time, certainly before you get to 45 days, but it is a continuous process to get you right back to where you were pre-flight.  Host: We'll take one more from social media. This one from Leo on Twitter. “What is the greatest lesson that a young person can learn from this mission, especially in these challenging times?”  Bob Behnken: I think the greatest lesson folks can take from our experience is one of perseverance. You know, Doug and I didn't get to this opportunity, and this team didn't get to this success without years of hard effort, you know, challenges along the way. It doesn't -- doing something complicated like developing a new spacecraft and launching it, developing a new rocket and then putting a spacecraft on top of it and launching it to the International Space Station is just a -- it's a tremendous level of effort that is required to accomplish that. And it is -- there are setbacks. There are challenges where, you know, a rocket performance isn't what you expected, or a propulsion system onboard a capsule isn't exactly everything that you thought it was, and you have to adapt to those challenges, and you have to overcome them and continue forward and maintain both optimism and paranoia as you go through that perseverance. And so those are all normal things as you try to accomplish, you know, challenging tasks, and so I'm hopeful that our experience, the entire SpaceX team's experience, and the NASA team's experience, one of just the focused effort for an extended period of time, you know, can lead to just awesome results if you stay focused, and so that message of perseverance is the one that I would want to share.  Host: We'll now go back to the phone bridge, starting with Marina Koren from “The Atlantic.”  Marina Koren: Hi, Bob and Doug. Welcome back. What advice would you give to future Crew Dragon passengers who are not astronauts? And a quick second question, you've been close friends for years, did your friendship survive this historic experience?  Doug Hurley: Alright. What advice would we give kind of the non-professional astronaut when they are flying on Crew Dragon? Purely that the SpaceX and NASA collaborated to build a tremendous vehicle that is very capable of the mission to go to and from low-Earth orbit safely. It's a comfortable vehicle. There are things that are just an aspect of flying in space that I think most folks don't quite realize or understand. There are times when it's uncomfortable. There are times when, of course, you can't take a shower. You know, going to the bathroom is a challenge. But I think in general, it's an outstanding vehicle, and they should be excited to fly onboard to get that experience if they're lucky enough to do it. And I think as far as our friendship, it certainly survived. If anything, it just got stronger. You know, being part of a crew with Chris and Anatoly and Ivan, it was just neat to see the team developed. You know, as Bob had mentioned before and I'm sure I did too, we have known Chris for a long time. I flew with Chris on our first flight together, and it just was really neat to see the Expedition 63 crew develop and work through the last few months, and it was very, very rewarding. And I think for me personally, maybe I didn't appreciate that aspect of it as much, you know, going into the flight because I think, you know, our huge concern and challenge was making sure DM-2 flew the way it ended up flying successfully. And so, it was neat, and it just was such a huge advantage I think for Bob and I that we are close friends that just the crew coordination part of it and flying Dragon was almost via telepathy sometimes. You know, we didn't even have to say anything whether we were pointing at something or if we just at that particular moment looking at that part of a display because that's what we knew would be the thing that was most important, and I just think that, you know, I know that doesn't necessarily always go into the selection process, but I think, you know, in this case, when we were selected to fly this mission together, it certainly gave us a distinct advantage over some crews. And it was certainly very much appreciated by me.  Bob Behnken: Yeah, just as Doug said, being able to add Chris to our friendship and Anatoly and Ivan is really how Expedition 63 worked out. You know, it was -- us focused on the mission. And Chris, as the commander of the space station, being able to shift into the support role when it came time for us to get docked and then us to shift into our support roles once we were onboard the space station, of course, the spacewalk activities have various sync points where kind of the leadership kind of moves around, and we were able to do that very seamlessly, and part of that is, you know, related to just how close and how strong our friendships were kind of across the board. And so -- and, of course, when we came to the end of the mission, and it was time to undock, Chris jumped back into that support role again and helped us with the cargo transfer that we needed to put in place, some of the powered payload activities. We just -- it was all very seamless. Folks understood what their responsibilities were, and we were able to, you know, cooperate and work together to make it all happen and get the mission done. And so, I would say, you know, our friendship is stronger, and we added some folks to our circle as well.  Host: Next is MaryLiz Bender from “Cosmic Perspective.”  MaryLiz Bender: Welcome home, Bob and Doug. I want to first thank you for sharing that wisdom on perseverance. You shared a lot of stunning images of Earth while you were on the station, and I really enjoyed the perspective you gave with the captions that you used. And I just wanted to ask, what compelled you to share so much, and what was your favorite location or feature to photograph?  Doug Hurley: Well, I think we can both answer that one. You know, for me, I just -- every time you look out the window of the space station, and certainly, we didn't get the opportunity that I thought we were going to get, you know, based on the description of previous crew members. Our time was used up a lot to make up for the fact that, you know, we were down to three crew members on the space station prior to us getting there, and I think -- and rightly so, the International Space Station Program needed us to get to work right off the bat. But the time that we did get to do that, you know, the perspective that you have from low-Earth orbit of our planet is just one of just complete awe of, first of all, how beautiful the planet is and that there are no borders that you can see from space, that the atmosphere is so thin, and then literally every time you look out the window, you see something different and even more beautiful than the last thing you saw the last time you looked out the window, and it's always different. And maybe more so this year than in past years that astronauts have taken photographs out the window, you know, the country, the United States, and the world has been dealing with so much chaos and drama and the pandemic, and all the things that have been going on in the world and, you know, if it were me, it would make me feel better to see these pictures from space, and so I think we just felt like it was a way to maybe have folks maybe have a distraction for a while and also to appreciate the planet that we've been given. You know, it is unique in that standpoint, and it is just beautiful to look at. And it's -- I personally feel it's our obligation to share what we see because not everybody is going to get to go to space and to just bring as much of the experience to everybody back on Earth is something I thought was very, very important.  Bob Behnken: You know, I think for both of us, we didn't expect to have a longer duration mission. We expected to have just a few short days, which would've really limited our opportunity to share the station life aspects or the things that you can see from low-Earth orbit or from the space station with folks. And when we got the opportunity for a longer mission, I think we both wanted to take advantage of that. You know, I think the Earth below us is a wonderful view -- just some amazing things to see. I'm a little bit -- I'm a physics-trained engineer background sort of a thing, and so I was really interested in the things that were examples of science or engineering or just physics below us or above us that was happening. And so whether it was lights shimmering across the ocean surface or it was sunrises or sunset in trying to figure out how to get a photo and share that so that somebody else could have the same wonder that we have when we get a chance to see it ourselves was what was really important to me. We had some interesting, you know, conditions during the flight. We had a period of time where we were in continuous daylight. We got to do a spacewalk in continuous daylight, which was just crazy to imagine, you know, being outside the entire time with the sun up the entire time. It was just a strange thing to kind of get your mind around, and we got to have that experience. And so, as a part of that, I think it took away the opportunities for us to get as many shots of the Comet NEOWISE that was rising. It kind of came in that same period. So, we had too much light to be able to see it very much. But just all those things that you can see whether it's lightning or the cities at night or look out at the Milky Way and see the stars in the background, or just see the glow of the Earth and see that it is not dark even at night compared to the darkness of space is just imagery that we wanted to share and maybe spark an interest of the wonder that we were able to see and whether it's a child or an adult that's out there so that in this year and in years in the future, folks can look at that and be inspired to have the kind of careers that we have had or, you know, chase a different dream than the one that we have chosen.  Host: Next is Irene Klotz from “Aviation Week.”  Irene Klotz: Thank you. I realize you're still digesting all of this, but if you -- if the decision were up to you about when to fly friends, family, other non-professional astronauts, do you think that the system is mature enough after just perhaps another two flights to have that kind of mission?  Doug Hurley: That's a good question. I think if it were me and it was a family member, certainly, as Bob described, there's a certification process that Endeavor hasn't completed yet, and it'll likely be weeks, and I think from my experience of flying fighters and testing fighters, you know, a first flight, there's a lot of scrutiny on a first flight, and there's a lot of work that goes into a first flight, but you can't let your guard down, and you've got to take a look at the data. You've got to listen to the hardware, and it is probably going to take a few flights because, you know, we certainly did our best, and I think the teams did their best to script this flight to be a full up test flight, but there are certainly things on Dragon that could be tested more. And there -- just for an example, you know, we dock to the forward part of the space station. There's certainly the likelihood that a Dragon is going to have to dock to a different docking port, either the Zenith -- I think it's the Zenith port that is likely to be next for a commercial vehicle. And that may sound somewhat insignificant, but it isn't, and so all the software that needs to go into the vehicle trajectory analysis and the things that they need to do in order to make that possible, and for our flight that was not possible. The software hadn't been written yet to do that docking port, so just things like that -- so I think it's going to take few flights before, and I think that's prudent, a few flights before we can consider this vehicle completely tested, and then as we all know, you know, the space business like a lot of those technically challenging businesses is not forgiving. So, the bigger thing to take a look at is to just not let your guard down and don't just assume because the last flight went perfectly that the next flight is going to go perfectly. You have to do that rigor and that analysis and that attention to detail, and you can't get complacent, and you can never get complacent with a space vehicle.  Host: And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks to all who submitted questions. And thanks to Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for taking the time to discuss this historic event. The Demo-2 mission is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, and we have more milestones coming up in the very near future. So, for the latest, please visit NASA.gov/commercialcrew. Thanks again for joining us. That will wrap up today's Crew News Conference.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 38: Stories of Her Strength.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your cohost today along with Jenny Turner, International Space Station flight controller and the chair of the Women Excelling in Life and Leadership employee resource group, more commonly known as WELL here on site.  Jenny, thanks for coming on.    Jenny Turner:   Yeah, of course, thanks for having me.    Host:  So, Jenny, tell us more about these employee resource groups and their purpose and the one you chair as well.    Jenny Turner:   Yeah.  So employee resource groups are here at JSC to help promote inclusion and innovation.  So there's nine total.  They focus on the experiences of different racial backgrounds, age, human systems integration, veterans, the LGBT community, employees with disabilities, and caregivers, and gender for WELL in particular.  So at JSC and everywhere, really, the diverse experiences, backgrounds, and skills that we bring to work every day are, really, I think, what makes us so competitive and successful.  So we really want to work to highlight that aspect of our community and just provide that resource for people in those groups, as well as allies.  So for WELL in particular we are focused on promoting and supporting women at JSC.  We provide mentoring opportunities so that women in management and entering into mid-level employees can connect.  We do some outreach with the committee -- I'm sorry, the community, especially when it comes to girls and STEM.  And we also have professional development luncheons with all sorts of topics that just also include personal development.  Of course, being the women's group, we do tackle some harder subjects that are sometimes uncomfortable.  But our intent is always, you know, never to accuse but just to make aware and kind of provide that forum for issues that affect us and the ones we love.   Recently, especially with today's climate, we've also worked with our employee assistance program counselors here to provide a safe space for discussion on harassment in the workplace and just provide resources for victims and witnesses.  Overall, yeah, it's just a great privilege we have to support the phenomenal women at the center.    Host:  Yeah.  You guys are doing great things around here.  I love it.  So let's kick it off with today's theme.  What's today's podcast all about?    Jenny Turner:   So it is -- it's just that, it's this focus that helps us highlight the tenacity of women everywhere.  As the National Women's History Project site summarizes, honoring women who fight all forms of discrimination against women.  So for WELL, we are doing a whole range of events or we have done.  We have a couple of outreach events that we did.  We did some with a first robotics group locally here with about 100 high school students and 13 women from NASA going out just to talk about our careers.  We've also done a joint event with the fitness center on site to promote wellness.  But our flagship event is actually the Wikipedia Editathon.  So we initially got this idea from an article on a similar event at the University of Houston.  So right now on Wikipedia there's -- only about 17% of biographies are women at all.  So what we're doing is collecting information and biographies of women at NASA and in STEM fields to create new pages or just update them with more information.  That way we can just help contribute to the presence of inspiring stories that women everywhere can have easy access to and say, \"Yes, my goals are possible and they're there within reach.\"   So we're really excited about that.  We're getting a lot of good feedback and a lot of good entries.  So it's looking good.    Host:  Exactly.  And we're going to expand on that in today's episode.  So Houston, We Have a Podcast is teaming up with WELL for Women's History Month to tackle this theme.  And we've wrangled four guests, all who are leaders here at the Johnson Space Center of different divisions across the center -- International Space Station, flight operations, engineering, and then finally human health and performance.  And we'll get to hear their story of how they got to NASA, how they persevered and rose to a leadership role.  So Jenny, who is the first guest on our list?    Jenny Turner:   So first up is Dana Weigel.  She's from the International Space Station Vehicle Office.  She's the current manager.  And she is also one of our executive sponsors for WELL.  So she helps to give us advice and support all of our activities here at JSC.   Host:  Great.  Let's right into it.  Producer Alex, cue the music.     [ Music ]    Host:  Dana, thank you so much for coming on the show today to sort of tell your story.    Dana Weigel:  Sure.    Host:  All right.  I wanted to start with just your childhood because becoming -- for you coming to NASA was almost normal, right, since you live so close?    Dana Weigel:  Yeah.  I was a couple towns over.  And, of course, we had family coming in from all across the United States.  And what they wanted to do was go to NASA.  And I remember telling my parents, \"No, do I have to go again?  We go there all the time.  I'm always going to NASA.\"  I've got these pictures of me as a kid.  Back in the day, by the way, you used to be able to come on site.  So there wasn't a Space Center Houston, you just came directly to NASA.    Host:  Oh, there was no gates or anything?    Dana Weigel:  Nope, completely open.  You could wander around kind of whenever you wanted.  But they did have this public area where they had this cardboard or a wooden spacesuit cutout.  And so I've got these pictures through the years of me poking my head through this spacesuit.  So I can't say I grew up imagining that I'd ever work [Laughs] -- work at NASA.    Host:  Maybe it was more subtle.  Maybe because you were here, it was just sort of ingrained in your childhood.  Maybe this is something I want to do.    Dana Weigel:  Maybe so.  It was familiar for sure, I'll say that.    Host:  So then what got you -- was it maybe coming here that you got interested in STEM?  Or was it parental influence that got you interested in, like, a technologies, science, math -- anything like that?    Dana Weigel:  You know, both my parents are biochemists, and my grandfather was a chemical engineer.  And he's really the one what introduced me to engineering, talked to me about what it was.  He was influential in starting early chapters of Society of Women Engineers, SWE.  So he talked to me about that.  And I thought, \"Hey, this is something a female could do.  I could go do this.\"  So I went off to go become a mechanical engineer.  And then I was heading down a path to go design prosthetics.  So I thought I'd be a mechanical engineer and then go be a doctor, and then go work in a clinic and do something related to designing legs or whatnot.     [ Laughter ]   Dana Weigel:  After I graduated, I started taking night classes to finish all of the biologies and all the things I hadn't had as an engineer that I would need to do the MCAT.  And I met a biomedical engineer who worked at NASA.  She worked in Mission Control and she talked about her job, and I thought, \"Wow, that sounds pretty interesting.\"    Host:  Biomedical, Mission Control, yeah.  Yeah.    Dana Weigel:  So I decided, \"You know, I got a few more years or maybe two more years, I think, of night classes I had to take to qualify for med school.  Why don't I see if I can work at NASA while I'm doing that?\"  So I applied and I became a contractor with Barrios Technology, working in Mission Operations Directorate is what it was called at the time.  And ended up with a job doing extra-vehicular activity, EVA, the spacesuits, the same suits I poked my head through, you know, for years as a kid.    Host:  Ah, coming full circle.    Dana Weigel:  Yeah.  And then I fell in love with it and decided, \"Why am I trying to go be a physician?  I'll just stay here and be a flight controller and work for NASA.\"    Host:  Did you end up finishing those two years or did you say, \"No, NASA's for me\"?    Dana Weigel:  I finished the classes.    Host:  All right.    Dana Weigel:  I did not take the MCAT.  By then I was hooked.    Host:  [Laughs] Really?    Dana Weigel:  Decided to stay, yeah.    Host:  So what were you doing in space suits specifically?  What were you working on?    Dana Weigel:  In mission operations there were kind of two functions.  One was being an instructor, so I would teach crew and teach other flight controllers about the spacesuit.  And then I also worked in Mission Control and was very fortunate I got to work Shuttle missions, Hubble missions, and Space Station missions as an EVA flight control.    Host:  Oh.  So okay, when you heard flight controlling, sitting in Mission Control, that sounds pretty cool -- that's exactly what you pursued.  You pursued sitting in Mission Control?    Dana Weigel:  I did.    Host:  All right.    Dana Weigel:  I did, and it was very cool.    Host:  [Laughs] What sorts of challenges did you have to get before you can sit in the main room?    Dana Weigel:  They've kind of got like a hierarchy.  It's interesting, it's set up like a pyramid.  There's what's called a back room.  And there were folks there who were looking at very detailed procedures and schematics.  And you go through a certification process, a lot of training, lot of certification, a lot of practice in simulations to get certified there.  And then typically have two different back room positions that you have to conquer before you can try to sit in the front room, the big front room.    Host:  What are those positions?    Dana Weigel:  So for the EVA office, which is where I was, there was one that was focused on the suit -- the spacesuit -- on the systems-side focused.  And then there was the what we call the test side, which is what you're actually doing.  So, like, for repairing the Hubble space telescope, understanding the tools, the requirements, what you have to do to change out boxes.  So those were the two big pieces for the area I was in.    Host:  And you, I guess, touched both then, right?    Dana Weigel:  I did.    Host:  All right.  Did you actually get to work on some of the -- I guess beyond the procedures, were you working on the hardware at all or was it mainly Mission Control-based?    Dana Weigel:  That's a good question.  So I think one of unique things about the area I was in with EVA, because it's such a -- it requires such a physical skill to do the job, we did spend a lot of time a couple years before the mission doing development runs in the neutral buoyancy lab to help figure out what types of tools would be needed, what types of crew aides, for example, and then depending upon who we were doing the work with, station program or Hubble, you'd go work with providers to help design and help figure out what you needed for the mission.    Host:  Okay.  So you were doing a little bit of both.  Did you get to actually suit up and go in the neutral buoyancy laboratory, anything cool like that?    Dana Weigel:  I did.    Host:  Oh, awesome.    Dana Weigel:  I am height-challenged.  So I'm actually on the smaller end of the scale.  So many years ago they were entertaining having what they call an extra small hard upper torso and they needed test subjects.  So I fit the bill.  I have very short arms.  So I did a large number of runs very early on, trying to help them figure out, you know, how you can optimize reach for the smaller end of the crew spectrum.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  How did that work with the shorter arms?    Dana Weigel:  It's very frustrating.    Host:  I can imagine.    Dana Weigel:  Very frustrating.    Host:  What was some of the more uncomfortable parts of it?  Was it the chest area where you could, I guess, with shorter arms trying to reach in front of you?  Or was it maybe the pressure that was causing maybe some strain on your fingers or something?    Dana Weigel:  You know, it's both.  The reaching in front of you, getting two hands in front of you on a work site is difficult, but also the way the vehicle is built, there's a certain handrail spacing that is designed in.  And so in a lot of cases even just the reach from one place to another could be challenging.     [ Laughter ]  Yes, you don't want to let go.  You don't want to let go -- that's key.    Host:  That's right, that's right.  Well, you're tethered, so you got that.  But still, you definitely want to hang on with both hands.  So then where did your path take you then?  Is it -- I know you became a flight director, but was it immediately there or were there some extra steps?    Dana Weigel:  Let's see, in 2004, I became a civil servant.  So that was probably maybe eight or nine years I had done the job.  And then a year after that, in 2005 I applied to be a flight director.  And I was selected, I was the first specialist discipline that had ever been selected to become a flight director.    Host:  So that means EVA then, right?    Dana Weigel:  Yeah.  I mean, historically the flight director office had pulled from disciplines or from what we call core disciplines, things like life support system or thermal, someone who's there all the time, 24/7, tons of hours in Mission Control, tons of time.  They understand the spacecraft.  They interact with all the other major kind of infrastructure systems.  Whereas a specialist is someone who comes in just for a certain activity, like robotics or EVA.  You come in to prep the spacesuits, do you the space walk, and then you leave.  So you have more limited time in Mission Control.    Host:  Yeah.  Okay.  So they wanted someone to lead Mission Control who was sort of used to being there all the time and knew how things worked all the time?    Dana Weigel:  It was the comfort zone.  That's just what had been done before.  And so this, I think, in their mind was a little bit of gamble.  There wasn't as much direct opportunity to watch a specialist on console and see how they perform.  You get many, many more opportunities with someone who's there all the time.    Host:  So how did you sell it?  You being in a specialist discipline, how did you sell it like, \"Yes, I'm the person you want to be in this flight director class\"?    Dana Weigel:  Yeah, that -- that's interesting.  Because the interview, I thought it would kind of be a generic vanilla interview, but it was very customized to how am I going to compensate for coming in as a specialist?  Every question was related to compensation for coming from EVA as a discipline and a specialist area.  So we talked a lot about that.  And, you know, anyone who can lead or has a certain set of capabilities, you can apply that in any number of different areas, right?  So knowledge is only one piece of the puzzle, you know?  Coming in with a certain set of knowledge, it will only get you so far, right?  So what you're really looking for is the rest of the adaptable skillset that someone else has.    Host:  So how did you build those skillsets, then, over time, over your time as an EVA, the skillsets to show that you were a leader, that you could lead the flight control team?    Dana Weigel:   I had a handful of unique opportunities.  One was after the Columbia accident I became the overall lead for operations for trying to figure out how we'd repair the Shuttle's thermal protective system.  So I ended up with a pretty large team, maybe 15 or so people in my area.  And we were working, of course, with engineering, and safety, and other directorates, too, trying to figure out how to solve that.  So I was fortunate in that I was involved in, you know, something that was pretty complex and had more, you know, in-depth kind of leadership responsibilities.    Host:  Yeah, I'm sure you sort of set that in the interviews, \"No, I'm very used to leading teams for very important things like that.\"  So then once you were sitting in the seat, I'm sure it wasn't just, \"All right, now you're accepted.  Let's lead the teams, please.\"  I'm sure you still had some struggles.    Dana Weigel:   Yeah, I think the first year that I was in the office was a challenge for the management team.  They didn't know -- they didn't know if they should just assign me the normal things they would assign someone else who had a core kind of discipline background.  So they did a number of odd things like customizing assignments and trying to keep it close to the EVA realm.  It was actually quite frustrating.  I was treated differently than the rest of my class of nine.  We were a class of nine.  So I actually thought at one point, \"Should I quit?  Should I leave?  Are they not ready for this?\"  And then I thought, \"Nah, I can do this job.  And I want to do this job.  I'm going to stay, I'm going to do it.  I'll show them.\"  I put my head down, okay, whatever assignments you want to give me, I'll knock them out.  I'll do it, even though I thought it was odd how they were managing that.  And then about a year into it, to my surprise, they gave me the largest assignment -- the first big assignment, really, of the whole class and everything changed.    Host:  Really?  Wow.  Okay.  So you had to prove -- basically putting your head down and saying, \"Okay, sure, give me whatever you want.  But whatever you give me, I'm going to own it.\"  And I guess that sort of showed.  It showed that you could take on this large responsibility.    Dana Weigel:   Exactly.    Host:  What was the large responsibility out of curiosity?    Dana Weigel:   Yeah.  So I actually ended up being assigned to the first increment.  So I think most people are familiar -- at least who work Space Station -- with what our increments are, but basically we've got a set of crew members who fly up on a Soyuz and come back on a Soyuz.  And so we've got a period of time that is an increment.  So I was assigned to lead the first increment and then also assigned to lead the first Shuttle assembly mission for my class.    Host:  Wow, all right.  [Laughs] Yeah.  Very big task and very new, too.  So how long were you a flight director, then?    Dana Weigel:   I did that for about ten years total in the office.  The last three years I was the deputy of that office.    Host:  Oh, wow.  All right.  So flight directors leading more flight directors?  [Laughs]    Dana Weigel:   That's something else, too.    Host:  Yeah [Laughs] really.  So then what made you want to -- what opportunities came up next that you wanted to not be a flight director anymore or lead flight directors?    Dana Weigel:   So this next change wasn't really my choice necessarily.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Dana Weigel:   During one of the space walks -- it was EVA 23 -- we had crew members Chris Cassidy and Luca Parmitano doing a space walk.  And about an hour into the space walk, Luca started noticing that his -- his com cap, which is kind a spandex cut-type cap that's on his head felt a little moist, felt wet.  And as the EVA went on, it started getting wetter and wetter.  And it became apparent that he had water in his helmet.  It's pretty scary.  Most of your contingency we've ever had on Space Station, the water ended up on the back of his head and worked its way across his eyes and over his nose.    Host:  Oh.    Dana Weigel:   And luckily, his mouth -- he still could breathe.  Could have drowned.  He was very calm.  And the actions he took saved his life.  But after that major failure, the program manager at the time, Mike Suffredini, kind of tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Hey, I need you to go lead this investigation.\"    Host:  It was because you had the EVA background?    Dana Weigel:   Because I had the background, but also he had worked with me on a number of other contingency situations in Mission Control.    Host:  Okay.    Dana Weigel:   And had had kind of seen me leading the teams.    Host:  Knew you could do it?    Dana Weigel:   He knew I could, I didn't know I could.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  All right.  So then this was -- I guess it took you away from this deputy role.  And now you were leading this investigation, a failure investigation.  What -- so I'm guessing you had a lot of challenges there, too?    Dana Weigel:   I did.  When he first asked me to do it, I said, \"Surely you have someone else who's qualified to lead a failure investigation.\"  I come from operations.  I don't build fault trees.  I don't -- I've never seen someone go all the way down to root cause in an investigation.  And, you know, he made the point that what's more important is having a strong leader, not having someone with the right knowledge, right?    Host:  Because you surround yourself with people --    Dana Weigel:   Yeah, that's the point as a leader, right?  It's not about what you know, it's about what you can draw out of people.    Host:  Yeah.    Dana Weigel:   So I led that.  It was about a year-long investigation.  A lot of hard work, fantastic team.  We've got a lot of expertise, not just here but at other centers that helped us out.    Host:  Wow.    Dana Weigel:   Learned a lot about errors we had made with water behavior on the ground versus on orbit.    Host:  Hmm.  Okay.  And then so I guess that was your new job, then, for a whole year?  And I guess you didn't go back to flight directing then after that?    Dana Weigel:   No, after that the program manager -- we happened to have an opening in the Space Station program and he asked me to come in and lead one of the offices there, which is what I'm currently doing now.    Host:  The vehicle office, right?    Dana Weigel:   Yes.    Host:  So what do you do in the vehicle office?    Dana Weigel:   So the vehicle office is responsible for building all the vehicle hardware, the system hardware, thermal systems, power systems.  There's a lot of building and maintaining that hardware.  And then also payload facilities.  So there are a lot of multiuser payload facilities that we have on the vehicle to do science club boxes, and combustion racks, fluid racks, a lot of other things.  So we build and maintain that hardware.    Host:  Okay.  So basically the vehicle being the International Space Station, you just got to make sure the gas is going, it's running?    Dana Weigel:   Yes [Laughs].  Yes, that's a nice, simplified way of saying.  Well, one of the other really neat things we're doing, though, with the vehicle, we are working on building the exploration-grade life support systems that could take us to Mars.    Host:  Oh.    Dana Weigel:   And it's really important that we test those in microgravity and in a relevant environment.  So you can't really emulate that on the ground.    Host:  Yeah, you got to make sure it's working in this.  Okay.  So that's on the International Space Station right now then?    Dana Weigel:   We're starting the build.  In fact, the first piece of hardware should go up this summer.  And we'll continue adding over the next three or so years, three to four years.  And then we're hoping to test it for a few years and get ourselves in a much better position for having reliable life support systems that could take us on to Mars.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  Extremely important job.  That's really, really cool.  So along this path that you're talking about from maybe starting with, you know, space is there but it's maybe I want to go into prosthetics, to eventually working your way up the management chain.  And now leading groups, leading teams, doing things that you didn't think you were going to do, leading failure investigation teams.  What sort of traits did you have or maybe work on to get you to be able to do these things?    Dana Weigel:   I mean, one thing for sure is being persistent.  If you want to do something, don't give up.  Put your head down, keep working towards it.  You know, I built my career on assignments that were not necessarily the most interesting or sexy assignments.  It doesn't matter what it is, if you do it well, people will recognize it.  You know, a lot of times I took the harder jobs that people just didn't want to touch because they didn't look fun.  And those can be some of your biggest successes.  The bigger the challenge, the more you're going to grow.  If you want to grow as a leader, you've got to put yourself into positions where you don't know everything, right?  You've got to really stretch really far so that you have to rely on the team.  You've got to kind of make that stretch from individual contributor to leading and being reliant on the team.  I mean, that's key.  A leader is only as good as the team that's following them.    Host:  So it seems like you weren't looking for -- no, that's not fun, I don't really want to do that.  It seems like you were almost seeking the challenge.  You're like, \"Yeah, I want to do that.  This is going to be hard, but that's something that I want to do.\"    Dana Weigel:   If something's broken and you can go fix it, you know, that -- you'll learn a ton.  You'll grow a lot from that.    Host:  All right.  I love this idea of persistence, of [Laughs] even if it's hard, someone's got to do it.  And I think I can do it, I'm going to challenge myself and improve my skills to get me to that point.  Very cool.  Dana, thanks so much for coming on and telling your story and really inspiring this idea of persistence.  So I appreciate you coming on.    Dana Weigel:   Thank you very much.    [Spacey Sound Effect]  Host:  Okay.  That was Dana Weigel talking about her journey and her current role as a leader in the International Space Station program.  So Jenny, who do we have next?    Jenny Turner:   So next we have Ginger Kerrick.  She's from the Flight Operations Directorate.  And she's currently the chief of the flight integration division.    Host:  Okay, through the worm hole we go.     [Spacey Sound Effect]    Host: Ginger, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about your story.    Ginger Kerrick:  Thanks for having me.    Host:  Of course.  So I kind of wanted to start from the beginning, just kind of establish the baseline of how you first even got into, I guess, your interest NASA but just STEM in general -- what was the inspiration there?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, sure.  I used to check out books from the library every Friday.  And I brought home one book when I was five years old called Astronomy and Astronauts.  And I read that book cover to cover and proudly went into the living room and proclaimed to my parents that yea verily, I know what I needed to do for the rest of my life.  And I absolutely needed to be an astronaut.    Host:  Wow.  So whatever course was going to take you there, that's the one you were going to go with.    Ginger Kerrick:  Mm-hmm.    Host:  Okay.  So then you started pursuing physics, right?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes.    Host:  And that's when you started going to -- I guess it transitioned into university, right?  So you started taking classes there?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes.  Early on in childhood we didn't have honors classes.  And so my mom would meet with each one of my teachers and tell them that Ginger was special.  So they would give me extra work and projects.  And so that worked out well early on.  And then eventually in high school got into honors classes, and then I zeroed in on I wanted to major in physics.  So I started off at the University of El Paso in physics and then eventually transferred to Texas Tech.    Host:  Okay.  Did you -- did you -- was it this goal that you had in the back of your mind that really helped you kind of excel?  Because you graduated in the second of your class in high school, right?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes, yes, by 1/1000 of a point, not that I carry that with me to this day.    [ Laughter ]   Yeah, it was the goal, but it was also my upbringing.  My dad died when I was 11 years old and my mom explained to me that I was not going to be able to go to college unless I had scholarships.  And so she explained the way to get scholarships was you do really well in sports or you do really well in school.  And so I thought, \"Well, okay, I need to go to college.  So I better do really well in both.\"  So when I graduated, I had a lot of different academic scholarships to choose from and some athletic scholarships to choose from.    Host:  Really?  What did you play?    Ginger Kerrick:  Basketball.    Host:  Oh, all right.    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, I was voted El Paso's Female Athlete of the Year for the city the year that I graduated, too.  So I played basketball and volleyball, and I had offers in both to go play at different places.    Host:  Okay.  So what made you choose the academic route over the sports route?    Ginger Kerrick:  Bigger scholarships and bigger schools.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Ginger Kerrick:  So four-year schools that I knew I could get a reputable degree from that NASA would recognize.    Host:  Okay.  Oh, that's right.  Because the ultimate goal is this astronaut, right?  So you were doing a lot of things to get to NASA particularly, right?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes.  I actually wrote to them when I was 11.    Host:  Really?    Ginger Kerrick:  And I asked what it took to get here.  And they wrote me back, there's a few -- and they said, you know, stay in school, stay out of trouble, listen to your parents.  And I had my little letter, so proud.     [ Laughter ]    Host:  That's very cool.    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah.    Host:  Hey, that would inspire me, too, if I got a letter from NASA.  Oh, NASA saying I need to stay in school?  I will do that [Laughs].  So in school, what -- how did that go?  Did it just -- going through physics classes and working your way to get to NASA?    Ginger Kerrick:  Well, early on it was pretty easy, to be honest.  I was at University of Texas El Paso.  I was taking 22 hours a semester, and I had a 4.0.  By then -- and I was living at home -- but then when I moved away, my first time away from home, I kind of, you know, got into a little bit of trouble because I stayed out too late, I hung out with my friends, I did things that my mom wouldn't allow me to do when I was living at home.  And I wound up with a fat 2.7 my first semester.  So I remember calling NASA and asking if that was good enough for their co-op program.    Host:  You called them back?    Ginger Kerrick:  After they stopped laughing, they said, \"Why don't you call us back when you get it above a 3.0 and we'll think about it.\"  And so I wound up losing one of my scholarships at Texas Tech and I had to get another part-time job.  So I worked three part-time jobs for the remainder of my college years.  But I got it back up to a 3.2, and that was good enough to qualify for NASA's -- it was a one-shot summer internship program.  So that's how I got my foot in the door.    Host:  Wow, so this goal in the back of your mind was really driving you?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, absolutely.    Host:  Yeah.  I mean, that's the only thing.  Because to work three part-time jobs, plus have that school that you got to maintain and you got to get -- you got to increase your GPA?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes.    Host:  All at the same time.  That's an insane amount of time.  I'm sure your social life was pretty much --    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, it was suffering and I was hungry.     [ Laughter ]  Because I couldn't afford a lot of food.    Host:  Yeah.    Ginger Kerrick:  So my mom would fly in every once in a while and take me to Sam's.  I'd be like, \"Yay.\"    Host:  But it got you there, right?  Then you ended up getting the summer internship at NASA?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, yeah.  So I got the summer internship here.  And I remember working for this gentleman named Jose [inaudible] in the safety office.  And I met him very first day, and I said, \"Look, here's the deal.  This is a one-shot deal and I want that internship.\"  Back then it was called the co-op program, what is now known as the Pathways intern.  I said, \"I want a co-op position.  And I don't know how to get it.  Do you have any ideas?\"  And he didn't.  And I said, \"Look, how about this?  I have friends that are working in other orgs.  What if I finish my work for you and then I go help them on their projects?  And then maybe their bosses will see me and maybe can I get their bosses to write me a letter of recommendation.  So if I get multiple letters, maybe then at the end of the summer you can walk down to the co-op office with me and all these letters saying that I've done good work everywhere and get converted.\"  And he's like, \"Okay.\"  And so that's what we did.  Toward the end of the summer I was like, \"Come on.  We got to go.\"  So he went to the co-op office.  I'm like, \"Tell him Ginger did a really good job this summer.\"   And I said yes, and not only him and these other individuals think that, too.  And he says, \"I think you should move her into the co-op program.\"  And they said okay.    Host:  So what was so intriguing about the co-op program that you worked so hard to get there?    Ginger Kerrick:  Because that was a promise.  So the internship, I come work here, I go back to school, NASA doesn't owe me anything.  But if I got into the co-op program, then it's a partnership.  I work for NASA a semester, I go to school; I work for NASA a semester.  And back then upon graduation, you're pretty much guaranteed a job.  More so than if I had just been a one-shot intern.  So that was my way of making sure that I got into a recognized agreement with NASA.    Host:  Okay.  So you worked hard in the summer internship to short of get into this almost sealed deal.    Ginger Kerrick:  More stable, yes.    Host:  A sealed deal.  And then you get hired on as a civil servant, too, right?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yes -- yeah, yeah.    Host:  So you get to do a lot of different things as a civil servant, right?  It seems like whenever you did get to NASA eventually, you moved around quite a bit?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, yeah.  So when I first got back, when I first started, that was May of '94.  And I was hired by safety, reliability, and quality assurance, and I worked in the bolts testing laboratory and the calibration laboratory.  And then after about a year doing that, I was converted to a materials research engineer where I just supervised the quality of some of the production that was going into the Space Shuttle and early on in the Space Station.  And after a year of doing that, my boss knew that I wanted to be an astronaut.  And so I went down and turned in my astronaut application.  And Duane Ross suggested that I get out of the area that I was in and get some exposure to operations.  And so Duane Ross introduced me to the concept of a rotational assignment in NASA where your organization will allow to go do some other job in a different organization for about a six-month period to get some exposure.  So I convinced my boss, I said, \"Hey, the guy that's the selecting official for the astronauts said I should do this, that you should sign here.\"   And so he let me go off, and I went to the Mission Operations Directorate as an instructor for the Space Station life support systems.    Host:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So, [Laughs] again, not only NASA -- we should go back on this -- not only NASA was the goal but astronaut.  Astronaut is part of this picture.  And it has to do with when you were a kid saying, \"This is what I want to do.\"    Ginger Kerrick:  Exactly.    Host:  So eventually what other paths did you get?  Did you get to start applying to be an astronaut?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, well, that was the story that that I was telling you there.  So I --    Host:  Yeah, yeah.    Ginger Kerrick:  In order to be -- to apply to be an astronaut, you need a master's degree and one year of technical experience.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Ginger Kerrick:  So when I hired on at NASA in '94 -- in May of '94 -- by May of '95 I had my one-year and I filled out that app.  And it just so happened they were having a selection that year.  So when he told me to change jobs to get some different experience, I went ahead and did that.  And I think I was 26 years old.  And I thought, \"All right, I'm going to get the coolest rejection letter ever on NASA letterhead to go with my one that I got when I was 11.\"  But it didn't what that way.  So I got a call right around, you know, October, November I guess from Duane and he said, \"Hey, we received 3,000 applications this year and we are choosing to interview 120.  And you are one of the 120.\"    Host:  Whoa.    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, that was my thought exactly.  So, you know, I just about lost my mind.  So I was ready.  Because back then the interviews were one week long.  So the actual roundtable talk part of the interview was only an hour.  But they had physical tests, psychological tests, and the medical tests that you had to go through for the whole week.  But I was ready to rock those out.  And I wound up getting -- my interview was scheduled in December of 1995.    Host:  Okay.  And then what happened?    Ginger Kerrick:  Well, during the interview they did a scan of my lower abdomen with an ultrasound, saw something, asked me to come back in for an X-ray, saw something and asked me to come back in for a CT scan.  And on the CT scan was clear that there were six white dots on one side and seven white dots on another.  I had kidney stones.  And I'd never passed one.  So I didn't even know that I had them.  But what I did know is that year NASA was instituting a new medical disqualification that if your body showed the capacity to form a single stone, that is lifetime disqualification from consideration as an astronaut.    Host:  Wow.  So just the medical -- you know, you had the qualifications, but this medical thing stopped it in its tracks.  Wow.  So then what happened?  I'm sure you were devastated?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, I was.  Yeah, I was dead inside.  I don't remember the last day of that interview week.  I remember being at home crying all day Saturday, all day Sunday.  I didn't go to work Monday, and I was contemplating quitting NASA altogether.  And Duane Ross called me Monday afternoon and he's like, \"Hey, I heard you weren't at work today.\"  I'm like, \"Man, that whole big brother thing really does -- he doesn't even work in my building.  How does he know?\"  They know everything But so he called me and I said, \"No, I couldn't bring myself to go to work.\"  And he says, \"How are you?\"  And I lost it.  I'm like, \"How do you think I am?  My life is over.\"  And so it's just this horrible response that was coming out of my mouth.  And I -- like, I took a step back and I heard myself and I thought, \"Golly, what a wuss.  That is not me.\"  When I was 11, I mentioned my dad died.  I watched him die right in front of me.    Host:  Oh.    Ginger Kerrick:  And so I'm thinking, \"Okay, this little 11-year-old girl that watched her die right in front of her and picked herself up and managed to get to where she is today is now going to be defeated by a few kidney stones?\"  I'm like, \"Oh, no, I'm not having that.\"  So we hung up the phone.  And I'm like, \"All right, this is one of the worst things that's ever happened to me.  I will acknowledge that.  But like when my dad died, there's nothing I can do about it.\"  And I did ask.  I'm like, \"Hey, my mom has two perfectly good kidneys.  We can swap these bad boys out and pretend.\"  Yeah, and they're like, \"No, you weirdo.\"  So I just said there's absolutely nothing I can do.  So I have to get past this.  And at the time I was teaching astronauts.  And I thought, \"Wow, this is a cool job.\"  So maybe -- maybe I am 26 years old and I don't know everything.  And maybe there are other job opportunities here that are going to be equally as rewarding or more rewarding than I ever imagined.   But to get myself out of that bed, I said, \"All right, I'm going to go to work and I'm going to say that I can't go into space.  But as an instructor for the astronauts I can teach the astronauts a little something.\"  So in an indirect way a little part of me would be going up with each one of those.  Okay.  Yeah, I can sell that to myself.  And I said I sell it to myself because I woke up every morning crying and wanting to quit.  So I'd sell myself this story and I would go to work.  Then I'd start having a little bit of fun.  And then I'm like, \"Oh wait, I'm supposed to be depressed.  I can't have fun.\"  But as the days went on or weeks went on, I didn't have to sell that story to myself anymore.  And I really started enjoying it and being open to new opportunities.  And it was after that mental mind shift that all kind of crazy opportunities came -- you know, were offered to me here at NASA.    Host:  Unbelievable.  Because the history, you know, your whole goal was defined by this astronaut thing.  So understanding that, you kind of have to redefine where can I find meaning?  And then you kind of described this process, that there are other places that I can find meaning in NASA and make a contribution -- a good contribution -- to human space flight.  And that's where you -- you know, some of the stuff you did, like, what was the -- you were the first non-astronaut CAPCOM?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, yeah.  So that was kind of crazy.    Host:  Yeah.    Ginger Kerrick:  So right after, you know, these interviews, about a year later I was assigned to the Expedition 1 crew.  So the first crew that would fly onboard the International Space Station.  And I was assigned as a Russian training integration instructor was the title, but big picture is they were getting the majority of their training in Russia, about 70% and about 30% in the US.  And because I was assigned directly to them, I went wherever they went.  So if they were in the service module as it was being constructed in the plant at -- in the facility in Moscow, I was in the service module with them.  If they were in Florida as the laboratory module was being constructed, I was in the laboratory module with them.  Every class that they took, I was there.  So in a weird way I got my astronaut training.  And so I did that for four years.  And then after they flew and I came back here and moved back to the US -- I was really living in Russia for the majority of those four years -- I talked to Randy Stone, who was head of the missions operations directorate at the time.   And I'm like, \"I have a very unique skillset now and I want to be able to contribute.  Where do you think would be the best spot for me?  I'm looking at existing jobs and it doesn't seem like it maximizes it.\"  And so I kind of leaned back in his chair and he's like, \"Well, have you ever thought about being a CAPCOM?\"  You know, short for capsule communicator, the people that talk to the crew.  I'm like, \"Well, those are always astronauts.  And so hello, I can't be an astronaut.\"  And he says, \"Well, do you know why they've always been astronauts?\"  And I had no.  And he says, \"Well, the people in space always wanted to talk to somebody on the ground that had flown in that vehicle, that had -- knew, you know, the tasks that they were assigned inside and out, understood the way the ground team were supposed to operate.\"  He's like, \"Look what would you have been doing for the last four years.  Have there been any other astronauts there with you that know the vehicle?  This is the first crew that's flown.\"  He says, \"So there isn't anybody like that.  But you have a leg up on that.\"  And I thought well, okay.  Sow called the chief of the astronaut office.   And they're like, \"Oh yeah, Ginger, sure.  Yeah.  We'll give it a try.\"  So he's like, \"All right, if you don't screw this up, maybe other people can do it, too.\"  And I'm like, \"Copy, don't screw it up.\"  And so my first day I remember being so nervous because the flight director on console that day was Norm Knight.  And he's now -- he was chief of the flight director office.  And he looked exactly like Gene Kranz with the haircut and everything.  And he was pretty scary.  And he was, like, \"What are you doing in here?\"  I thought, \"Oh my goodness.\"  But I won him over that day with both the familiarity I had with the crew.  And there was -- I think we had a Freon leak in the Russian air-conditioner that week.  And I'm like, \"Oh, yeah, here's a copy of the air-conditioner, and here's what it looks like, and he's where it's leaking.  And all the Freon could leak out and it's still safe for the crew because it would be below these limits.\"  And he's like, \"Who are you?\"  But it was great.  And I loved that job.  I love that job so much.  And I would never have thought that I could do that.    Host:  Wow.  So now you're in this leadership role, talk about the transition from this operational role to now you're starting to be a part of the leadership of flight operations?    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah.  So four years as a CAPCOM, I sat next to the flight director.  And I thought, \"Huh, they're in charge.  I could be in charge.\"  And people -- that's about as much thought as went into it.  And people were telling me, \"No, you can't be a flight director because no CAPCOM has ever been a flight director.\"  And I'm like, \"Well, heck, you know.\"    Host:  No astronaut has ever been a CAPCOM.    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, no astronaut's ever been a CAPCOM.  So I'm going to roll the dice.  So I applied and I got selected as a flight director in 2005.  So, the leader of Mission Control.  And the ironic thing in being selected in that position is if I'd have been picked as an astronaut, I would have been one of over 550 people to fly in space because that's how many we've had fly in space so far.  But to date, there's only been 92 flight directors in the history of NASA.  And at the time I was number 60.  So I had actually joined a more elite leadership team than I had envisioned for myself.  But I loved working that position.  I was also the first female Hispanic flight director ever selected.    Host:  Wow.    Ginger Kerrick:  And I loved being in charge.  I loved having that responsibility of the lives of the crew, the integrity of the spacecraft, and execution of the mission.  I loved having that on my shoulders.  And did I that for eight years.  And I worked both Space Station and Shuttle.  And I could have done that job forever.  But my boss came in and pretended to ask me a question, but it was really a reassignment in disguise.  And he asked me to join his management team with the Mission Operations Directorate, initially managing the budget, the people.  So budget of roughly $200 million and about 1,100 people that contributed to the International Space Station success in the Mission Operations Directorate.    Host:  Do you think it's a place that maybe you not necessarily envisioned your ending up but you're happy in?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, each job is, like, the coolest job ever.  Every time I get a new job, I'm like, \"All right, all right, nothing could be better.  Oh, wait, okay, now I have a new job.  And this actually is better than the last job.\"  So that job was awesome.  The flight director -- the CAPCOM was awesome, flight director was awesome.  And then I did this other management job for four years and that was awesome.  And then a year and a half ago, my boss again -- I should get nervous when he comes around -- asked me to start up a brand new division in the Flight Operations Directorate, which we hadn't stood up a new division in a number of years.  But with us returning to launching and landing vehicles from US soil, we realized we were a little bit behind the power curve in ensuring that everything we needed to ensure the safety of the crew members associated with those tenacities was in place.  So we formed a brand new division from scratch.  He wanted it up and running in 45 days.  And I got it up and running in 45 days.  And we're about a year and a half old now.  And now this is the coolest position ever [Laughs].  Because I get to manage 160 of the brightest minds.   I have -- I'm responsible for operation safety of all these brand new vehicles that they're building, the training on the vehicles, the hardware inspections, the software testing.  And I just -- I love it.    Host:  Wow.  I just -- I really appreciate the fact that despite setbacks and despite not meeting these original goals that you set for yourself earlier in your life, you can still find meaning and you can still contribute in a big way that makes you happy.    Ginger Kerrick:  Yeah, I think a lot of people just fall into the pit of despair.    Host:  Yeah.    Ginger Kerrick:  And while it's fine to spend a few days in there, mourning the loss of a dream you had, you need to pick yourself back out of that.  Because there are -- you know, we don't always they everything.  There are other things that we have not considered that could bring us great joy.  And I am a living example of that.    Host: [Laughs] Well, I wanted to end.  So the theme of this episode is Nevertheless She Persisted.  And it has to do with this idea that maybe there are setbacks, maybe there are obstacles along the way.  Do you have a piece of advice that you want to give maybe to women trying to do exactly what you were doing, maybe achieve a goal and trying to push through despite many setbacks?  Some kind of piece advice that we can walk away with?    Ginger Kerrick:  Oh, sure.  You know, for each case that you're confronted with, ask yourself if there is something under your control that you can do.  So, like, with the examples that I had with my dad dying, no.  With the kidney stones, no.  But there were other encounters that I had, you know, a teacher who told me that little girls shouldn't study science when I was 13.  And I could have just said, \"Oh, okay,\" and just withdrawn from the class instead of, you know, \"What is your problem, dude?  I love science.\"  And so there are times in your life.  So you just need to ask yourself that question.  And if there is do, do it and get creative.  Sometimes there won't be a process for it, like, there wasn't a process for how I could turn my summer internship into a permanent co-op position but invent one.  And if you're passionate enough about what you want to do, you will find that.  But if you find yourself in a case where there is nothing you can do, allow yourself that time to mourn that loss.  That is human nature.  That is normal.   But don't get stuck there.  So whether it's asking for help from friends or family, pick yourself back up and dust yourself off and look around and see if there is something else out there for you.    Host:  Wow.  Your passion for what you do is extremely inspiring.  Thank you so much for coming on today.    Ginger Kerrick:  Thank you very much.    [Spacey Sound Effects]  Host:  And that was Ginger Kerrick talking about her journey to her current role as the leader in -- as one of the leaders, actually, in Flight Operations.  So Jenny, who do we have next?    Host:   So up next we have Julie Kramer White.  She is the deputy director of engineering for all of Johnson Space Center.    Host:  Okay getting a little dizzy flying through these wormholes.  But let's do it anyway.  Producer Alex, bring us through.    [Spacey Sound Effects]  Host: Julie, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about your story and kind of how you are now one of the leaders in engineering, right?    Julie Kramer White:   Yeah, it's my pleasure.  It's great to be here.  Thanks for having me.    Host:  Fantastic.  I kind of want us to start with your inspiration for getting into this field, STEM.  You said that you didn't really have a lot of, I guess, engineering influencers, but you ended up in engineering.    Julie Kramer White:   Right, yeah.  I grew up in the Midwest, I grew up in Indiana, didn't have any engineers in my family but sort of a product of a 1970s push to put -- match up women who had aptitudes in science and math to STEM-type fields.  And of course we didn't call it that then, but that's essentially what it was.  And so I was very good at math and definitely had a mechanical aptitude.  And the teachers saw that, and they started saying things to me like, \"Gee, you ought to go into medicine or you ought to go into engineering.\"  This thing engineering that I didn't really know too much about what it was.  Medicine didn't really interest me, too glory.  So I decided to start to understand more about engineering.  Luckily, growing up in Indiana, Purdue was a local school for me, it was a local option.  So in-state tuition, couple hours from home, you know, mom would do my laundry on the weekends.  So I wound up pursuing an engineering degree at Purdue kind of not really knowing what that really meant in terms of connection to NASA.   But I knew really early from high school that if I was going to go into engineering, I wasn't just going to go into engineering, I wanted to go work at NASA.  Shuttle was starting, you know, in the 80s, and so I saw Shuttle program start up.  And I thought, \"Wow, what a great way to do engineering would be to work at NASA.\"  So that's what I had decided when I was in high school, what I wanted to do.    Host:  So I guess it was watching some of the shuttle launches, and were you, I guess, a Trekkie at that point?    Julie Kramer White:   I was, I was definitely a Trekkie.  I was really hard-core, old-school Star Trek.  Not this new stuff.  You know, the old-school Star Trek.  Scotty, big fan, you know, James Doohan fan club.  Yeah, I was that nerdy.  And so, yeah, I was a big Star Trek fan.    Host:  Cool.  So I guess these sequence of events, this influence in the Shuttle mission, and the Trekkie-ness, and then going to Purdue, which ultimately had a great NASA connection, kind of let you to, I guess -- when did you start thinking, \"Okay, now is the time to apply to NASA\"?    Julie Kramer White:   Yeah, it did.  It sort of stumbled in actually.  It's kind of embarrassing to admit now in retrospect, but kind of growing up in Indiana I really didn't appreciate the connection that Purdue had to NASA.  I mean, obviously I went to Purdue, I studied in Grissom Hall.  That probably should have clued me in, you know, given the first man that walked on the moon was from Purdue.  You know, those things, those connections I probably should have made.  But I really didn't go at it that way.  I mean, I wound up at Purdue through a combination of circumstances.  Really glad I did.  Wound up in the co-op program because when I started expressing to my professors an interest in working at NASA, they said, \"Hey, you got to check out this co-op thing.  You'll love it,\" right?  So you go off and you work some, and then you get school work.  And so I wound up hiring in -- at Purdue you do five co-op terms.  So I hired in as a freshman.  And so came here as a co-op literally having had only three semesters of college, basically my first couple classes in calculus and my first class in physics, and they sent me to NASA.    Host:  Okay, now build a spaceship.    Julie Kramer White:   Yeah, so build a spaceship.  So that certainly led to its own combination of interesting circumstances.  But when they assigned me to my first assignment -- and it was a lot of old Apollo engineers that worked in the group that I was in.  And one of my favorite stories is the first office they assigned me to, it was three Apollo guys.  And one of them, his favorite thing to do to co-ops -- I know now -- is to drop a bunch of differential equation books on their desk and tell them this is what they need to know to work at NASA.  Now, of course, I've had two classes in calculus, so it was horrible, horrible, horrible.  I went home and I cried.  I did cry.  I went home and called my mom.  It was just awful.  Now, you know, so -- now it's fine, but it was a little bit shocking at first.    Host:  Yeah, that will definitely make your eyes go wide.  You're like, \"Oh, man, I'm so not ready.\"    Julie Kramer White:   I'm so not ready.  I am so not ready for this.  Right?  So a lot of it was just not being intimidated really.  And I think I look back on a lot of my experiences early on in NASA -- and I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more about them -- but that was a lot of it was just not being intimidated, right?  You couldn't be intimidated, you could never let somebody's rank or their age or things kind of throw you off point.  You had to stick with it so.    Host:  Did you have a mentor that sort of helped you along or was it like this was like an internal decision, like, \"I'm not going to let this bother me\"?    Julie Kramer White:   Yeah, absolutely.  I definitely had several mentors, but probably my biggest early career mentor was a guy name Stan Weiss.  He was a structural engineer, he worked Apollo, he had worked the lander, and then had come into the early shuttle Orbiter program and was in Orbiter, subsystem manager in primary structure, which was what I would eventually become.  I was his protege.  I was told that I was number six, and that he'd been through five and so far they've all kind of cried and gone home.  So I was sort of the, you know -- I was the sixth one.    Host:  He didn't tell you that on day one, did he?    Julie Kramer White:   Couldn't make a match.  No, they told me that afterwards.  They told me afterwards that it was a good thing that I had finally stuck because he was getting close to retirement and they couldn't find a good match.  But I stayed with him for a couple years until he retired.  Showed me the ropes you know, introduced me to all his connections, sort of a ready-made network, which is hugely important.  I think one of the things we struggle with today with how lean the budgets are and how lean the staffing profiles are, it's hard to double up in a lot of these areas and put people in the kind of relationship that I had with Stan.  But it's so fundamental because, I mean, basically when he retired, I inherited his network, right?  So I started with a 52-year-old man's network at the age of 25.    Host:  Wow, okay.    Julie Kramer White:   So it was a pretty amazing step in terms of breadth of ability to talk to people and get information and influence decision-making.  I really kind of picked up where he left off rather than having to start fresh on my own.  So when I do a lot of my discussions with young folks, I talked to them, people say, \"Hey, your mentors are important, developing these networks are important.\"  You can't even imagine at 25 how important that is because it gives you just a massive, massive leg up in terms of your ability to solve problems and gather information and perspectives.    Host:  But you had to put the work in as a co-op, too.  You had to have the drive, I guess, to follow your mentor and say, \"Yes, these are relationships that I want to maintain even while he's still here.\"  And then look how it turned out, now he's retiring and you have this network of people.    Julie Kramer White:   You bet.  And by the time he retired, I probably had about a -- probably almost a decade of works across the various organization.  I was mostly in structural mechanics division, but I have spent time in the machine shops and I had spent time in all the branches of ES.  So I had worked all different aspects of the product line that our structural mechanic division supports, so I had done thermal and I had done materials and failure analysis, I had done loads and dynamics, I'd done stress, I'd done mechanical design and test.  So I'd done all those things and then spent, you know, again, several years with him before he retired.  You kind of have to have -- you have to have the domain knowledge first.    Host:  Right.    Julie Kramer White:   Right?  And then be able to have the network to apply that domain knowledge, right?    Host:  Yeah.    Julie Kramer White:   Right, so --    Host:  So how do these -- how do these elements sort of come together to really test your knowledge in order to eventually move up the ladder?    Julie Kramer White:   Right.  So there have been a couple sort of seminal events in my career.  Once I had worked my way up through instruction mechanics division and was ready to start working out broader, I sort of joke that all failures are ultimately structures and materials related other than software.  So -- and so as a structures and material guy with a background and a failure analysis background, I did a lot of cross-division work.  I worked with our power and propulsion group in engine failures.  I worked with our mechanical systems folks in mechanism failures.  And so I got a chance to kind of branch out and apply some of these things mostly on Orbiter.    Host:  Okay.    Julie Kramer White:   But on the Shuttle Orbiter.  But then eventually in 2003 I was in the vehicle engineering office, and 2003 is when we had the Columbia accident.  And I just happened to be in the right place at the right time as sort of -- it's odd to attribute that sort of saying to something that's such a tragedy for the NASA family.  But for me professionally I was able to bring together my background in structures because I'd grown up with the Orbiters.  I knew each one sort of intimately from a structures perspective.  I could have told you by looking at the primary structure which Orbiter you were talking about and the history about that particular vehicle.    Host:  Wow.    Julie Kramer White:   So I had a very strong background in the primary structure, specifically in the wings, which were one of my areas of the vehicle.  I had a failure analysis background.  I had a materials background.  I'd done a lot of accident investigation-type work.  So I was familiar with a lot of the technique and just sort of happened to be in the right place at the time.  Columbia happened, I came home to JSC and was sent immediately into the field to go do debris recovery.  Because of my background with the primary structure, I was able to work with the USA and the Boeing representatives to gather together the key debris to be sent on to Barksdale and then down to Kennedy for the investigation.  Then I returned to JSC and happened to be in the mission management team meetings related to Columbia and found that as people were trying to describe what was going on with Columbia, they just didn't really have a very good knowledge of what was happening at KSC and didn't have any knowledge of the debris.   So they would describe scenarios that basically were physically impossible because the debris existed and was on the grid -- what we called the grid, where we laid out the debris down at KSC.  So through the process of those meetings where I was able to describe to them why scenarios were not valid because of the physical evidence that was available to us, management recognized there was this missing link between what was going on at KSC and what was going on at JSC.  And so I was sent to KSC to help make that linkage.    Host:  Yeah.    Julie Kramer White:   And eventually became the lead for the failure analysis side of the debris reconstruction.  So I had a team of greybeards, old NASA and Rockwell guys that worked with me to synthesize thousands of failure analysis reports that were coming in from the failure analysis team, from the materials engineers, and the labs all across the agency, and then some academic labs outside the agency -- to bring that data in, synthesize it, and then corroborate theories about what had happened or did not happen based on the physical evidence.  So we were that linkage for the MMT and then ultimately for the [inaudible] to help interpret what was going on with the debris.  So it's just to me it's always amazing when I look at that scenario, I would have never thought as I established my professional career, and worked in primary structure, and had an interest in failure analysis, and had an interest in accident investigation, and had this MMP background, and just happened to be the wing guy/gal, right, that when this thing happened and I happened to be in the right place at the right time to be able to say, \"Hey, I have a skillset that's kind of unique -- a unique combination of these things, and I can really help you move forward what you need to do in the investigation.\"   And management just basically plucked me up and put me down at KSC and said, \"Okay, help us figure out what happened.\"    Host:  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  All this work that you're putting into building yourself and kind of moving along in your professional career leads to this movement where they need exactly you.  Because you have that background knowledge and you have the connection that they're missing.  That's fantastic.  That must have opened up a bunch of doors and led to where you are right now.    Julie Kramer White:   Yeah, absolutely.  I did wind up shortly after Columbia taking a brief break because I had my daughter.  I happened to be pregnant during the Columbia investigation as well, which --   Host:  Oh, wow.    Julie Kramer White:   -- I kept to myself because I didn't think they'd be real keen [Laughs] -- real keen on knowing that.  So I did just kind of keep that one to myself.  But showed back up at JSC seven months pregnant, which was kind of interesting for my boss.  But anyway, then I took a leave of absence.  But while I was on this leave of absence, I got a call that basically said, \"Hey, as a byproduct of the Columbia investigation, we're standing up this thing called the NASA Engineering Safety Center where our goal is to be able to bring together these technical experts to offer sort of hired gun expertise into programs, not just manned space flight but all of NASA's high value programs and to offer a resource to the engineering teams and the programs that support those projects and be able to bring more resources and more engineering support.\"  And so I went and did that.  And I was there loads and dynamics what they call a TDT, sort of their lead in that discipline, technical discipline area.   Built up a team at that time, helped stand up the NESC and built this team across the ten centers.  Because the intent was that the teams would draw upon the best expertise from all ten centers.  So I had to basically go cold call, you know?  I had very good relationships with Marshall Space Flight Center based on previous experience and very good connections at Kennedy, the manned space flight centers.  But I had virtually no exposure to the robotic centers or to the satellite centers, research and development.  I did have a pretty good relationship with Langley because growing up in structures here at JSC we have a very sort of tight relationship with Langley.  So those were good.  But I mean, basically cold calling six other centers, going, \"Hey, I'm this new guy at the NESC.  And can I get some resources to go work these things?\"  And we built up these teams and then started taking these teams of people and really forging them into a team that has sort of common objectives and to be able to bring sort of the best attributes of each center.   Because each center approaches things culturally and technically just a little bit different just based on well, hey, this is a human space flight center, this is a robotics center, this is a satellite or more of a research and development -- kind of how they grow up, they approach problems a little bit differently.  So you're trying to harness sort of the best of all those ways of looking at things to get a better answer.  But it causes some interesting conflicts, too, because the centers do think differently.  So we worked our way through that whole process to sort of build these functioning -- highly functioning teams.  And that was a great experience.  I did that for about three years.  And then that wound up providing the next opportunity was as Orion was being formulated -- it wasn't Orion at the time, it was CEV was being formulated -- the administrator at the time, Mike Griffin, had a very specific objective of it being supported by ten centers -- all ten centers, which required key leaders that had experience at all ten centers.  And so NESC became one of the places where they looked for potential people to put into leadership positions.   And when they were looking for the chief engineer, I'm absolutely 100% convinced -- you know, I never asked Mike if this was the case, but I'm absolutely 100% convinced that if I had not had the experience with all ten centers, I would never have gotten the Orion chief engineer job.  Because even though I had a lot of the good technical background pieces of it, he really needed somebody who could make a collaborative environment with ten centers work since the engineering was being drawn from matrix at all the different centers.    Host:  Seems like you're working so hard towards -- I guess, going back to this point of kind of improving your career.  And then all of a sudden there just comes this need for you, for specifically you and your background.  Like, you're working with all ten centers.  Hey, we need someone with an engineering background that has worked with all ten centers -- here you are.  So how much do you think of it --    Julie Kramer White:   Hey, I'm here.  I could do that.  Could I have that job?  Yeah.    Host:  So how much do you think of it as persistence and hard work versus right place, right time?    Julie Kramer White:   Sure, sure.  Well, I think it's a little bit of both, right?    Host:  Yeah.    Julie Kramer White:   Because you can always be at the right place at the right time, but if you don't have the qualifications, right, you're never the right choice, right?  So first and foremost, absolutely what has to come is the qualifications, the engineering background or for whatever it is you're trying to be able to do.  And then, you know, so that's where I think more the persistence part of it comes in.  And sometimes it's really difficult because it's not like if you'd asked me at year number seven in my career, \"Well, what exactly are you developing yourself towards, right?\"  To me, I was just taking one step right after the other, trying to do more challenging things, trying to broaden my own skills and sort of naturally with those, taking on each of those challenges, and persisting through different challenges, you sort of built this portfolio of experience that you could never really have anticipated, \"Wow, okay, I'm going to show up at this point on the timeline and I'm going to be just the right person that can fill the need.\"  But I think it does happen that way more often than people think.   If you really prepare yourself, you know, that it tends to happen that way.    Host:  So if you had to leave our listeners with just a piece of advice to sort of get to whatever goal that you're trying to do.  It sounds like this was -- it was a goal to just try to advance your career, I guess, would be the ultimate goal.  What was the thing that was driving you along that way?    Julie Kramer White:   Right.  So I think, you know, every -- I think every -- well, I won't say every engineer.  I think a lot of engineers enter the engineering field sort of seeing a chief engineer function as sort of a pinnacle of that career.  It's sort of recognized as wow, this is what I would like to be when I grow up.  You know, some people aspire to program management, some people aspire to flight directors or astronauts.  But sort of in the engineering field you kind of look at that job and you go, \"Wow, if you're a chief engineer, somebody thinks you must know a lot about engineering, and a lot about systems engineering, and a lot about dealing with teams,\" which were all things I was interested in and had sort of worked on my career.  So I was kind of climbing towards that -- climbing towards that end goal.  And so just in the process, it can take just a lot of persistence and sticking with it.  It's funny that you would say persistence because when I talk out in universities or even in grade schools, that's probably the thing I talk most to students about.   I mean, I don't consider myself the world's best engineer.  I mean, I'm a good engineer.  I have a solid academic background.  Purdue was great.  I've got great life experience, but I have a ton of subject matter experts that worked with me on Orion and propped up every decision we made in Orion.  I was never the best pyro guy, or the best structures guy, or the best engine guy, right?  I had these a lot of really good experts, but I had great team skills, right, to be able to solicit from then, you know, the information they need, to be able to advocate for them.  And so for me, to be a chief engineer was sort of to be able to exercise those aspects of the job, sort of the soft skills of the job.  And so when I talk to people at the grade school, college level I say, \"Hey, your fundamental expertise is absolutely important.  That's where you've got to start.  But these other soft skills, right, the teamwork, the being able to work in teams, being able to communicate,\" right?  People talk in school about how important communication is, but it's really no joke, right?   I think honestly the difference between people that wind up in leadership positions and people that wind up being subject matter experts, there are places for both.  But when you're the one that's advocating for that broader team, you know, your communication skills are absolutely imperative.  Because if you screw up on -- there's somebody else that's feeding you all the right technical data, right?  I mean, that's their job is they're feeding you the right lines.  But if you screw it up in the delivery, right, it can really make a difference on how the decision is made.  So I always felt like it was my job to make sure I could extract that data and synthesize it, right, and be able to provide it in a way that program managers could make decisions.  So there's just so many different aspects of the job and so much of it has to do with just flat-out persistence, right?  Just flat-out you don't give up, you just keep at it, and you keep at it, and you keep it, and you keep at it.  And that's sort of -- in Orion that was always a buzzword, right?  We've been at it for a while.  I know, you know?  So I -- I mean, I was there for 11 and a half years actually, was recently moved up into the engineering directorate management.   So now I'm deputy director up in engineering.  But I was in Orion for 11 years -- that's persistence right there [Laughs].  So but watched Orion go through really hard times, through a cancellation sort of [inaudible] quote unquote \"cancellation\" and then a resurrection as MPCV.  And then through the flight test and getting ready now for the second flight test.  So takes a lot of persistence to hang in with some of these long-term human space flight programs that can last decades.  So yeah.    Host:  Yeah, I can definitely sense your passion for it, though.  And that's much appreciated.  It's really inspiring to hear your story.  So Julie, thank you so much for coming on --    Julie Kramer White:   Great, my pleasure.    Host:  -- and just telling your story.    Julie Kramer White:   Thank you.    [Spacey Sound Effect]  Host:  And that was Julie Kramer White talking about her journey through her current role as a leader in engineering.  So one more to go, Jenny.  Who do we have as our last guest?    Jenny Turner:   All right.  Last but not least is Cathy Koerner.  She's the director of Human Health and Performance.  And as a special shout out from WELL, she was our -- one of our executive sponsors for the past two years.  So we're really excited to hear her story.    Host:  Oh, very cool.  All right.  Let's go to that talk with Cathy.  Alex, let's do the thing.    [Spacey Sound Effect]  Host: Cathy, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.    Cathy Koerner:   Glad to be here.    Host:  Let's start from the very beginning, where does your story begin?    Cathy Koerner:   So -- goodness.  So when I was in school, I was really good in science and math.  And so my father strongly encouraged me to get into engineering.  And so I went to the University of Illinois.  I ended up an aeronautical and astronautical engineering degree.  Did undergrad work.  And then I had a professor who said, \"Hey, you should consider grad school.\"  I did grad school, got a master's degree.  And somewhere along the way space became something that I was very interested in.  And I got an opportunity to intern with a company to learn more about space stuff and to do some work for them.  And eventually ended up working at JPL.  I actually started my sort of -- sort of NASA career because they're a NASA center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California doing lunar Mars missions.  Was there for a little while and then came here to the Johnson Space Center and was hired right away into Mission Operations.  So what is now Flight Operations originally when I got here was called Mission Operations.   I did Shuttle flight control for many years.  I was a propulsion expert -- that's my background.  And then after spending several years doing that and working my way through certifications and working lots and lots and lots of Shuttle missions -- over 50 of them, actually, in my career -- I ended up with the privilege of becoming a flight director.  I spent seven years as a flight director for both Space Shuttle and International Space Station, got my opportunity to do both of those when the Columbia accident happened.  My portion of the investigation was completed as a Shuttle flight director.  And I had the opportunity to train and become an ISS flight director.  So I got to do that as well.  So I have been here at the Johnson Space Center for over 25 years.  Most of my background is in operations.  I kind of worked my way up through missions operations organization and was on staff to the director.  And then my husband became my boss.  And they said, \"How can we help you find a new job, Mrs. Koerner?\"     [ Laughter ]  Which actually was really great.  And it's one of the things that I like to encourage people about: If you get in a situation where you have to step out of your comfort zone because mission operations clearly was my comfort zone, take advantage of that and try something new and different.  Which is what I did, I ended up going to the Space Station program office.  And I worked in the Space Station program office for seven years in varying roles and having different responsibilities, most of them having to do with the International Space Station as a vehicle or with the visiting vehicles that approach the International Space Station.  And then after doing that for a while, I was really traveling lot and I had some kids that were at an age where they were very active.  And I thought, I don't want to deal with this job where I have to travel every other week.  I want to be more available to my children.  And so I was looking for other opportunities.  And someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Hey, you should consider Human Health and Performance directorate.   They're looking for a deputy director, maybe you should go there.\"  Which is, again, completely outside of my comfort zone because I don't have any background in anything medical.  And my perception of the organization was that it was strictly a medical organization.  And I was wrong about that perception.  The Human Health and Performance directorate does medical, but it also does human performance-related activities, which has an engineering flare to it.  So I was fortunate enough to have been selected as the deputy and then a year later to be given the opportunity to be the director of the Human Health and Performance directorate.    Host:  How about that?  So I mean, if you were being considered as deputy directory for HHP, you, when you said you were in the International Space Station program kind of moving around, that's when you started keep of moving up.  Because obviously to be considered as a deputy director, you have to have some level of management experience.    Cathy Koerner:   I did, yeah.  I -- when I went to the space station program, and actually, if you looked at it from an [inaudible] perspective, it actually looked like I took a couple steps backwards because I went from being on a director staff to being a deputy division chief, so to speak.  So down several layers in the organization or in a different organization.  But that really gave me the opportunity to rely on different skills, on my management skills and my leadership skills.  It gave me an opportunity to go back and to be a supervisor and to help develop other people.  And I really get a lot of joy out of doing that for people.  I enjoy developing individuals, helping them reach their goals.  I get tremendous joy from just seeing them be successful.  And so the opportunities that I had in the Space Station program really set me up for being at a direct level and on senior staff here at the Johnson Space Center, mostly base it gave me both supervisory experience but also budget experience in dealing with the varying international players that we have now with the International Space Station.   And really, with anything we do in space exploration these days, it's going to have to have international partnerships.  So I really learned a lot in those years.    Host:  Do you find that managing people is something that you just found you were kind of naturally good at?  You just kind of got thrown into the world and you were like, \"Huh, this is something that I really like.\"  Or was it something that maybe through your engineering experience you sort of maybe learned from mentors or developed those skills throughout that process?    Cathy Koerner:   I think it was probably a little bit of both.  I had some amazing mentors throughout my career who really told me in no uncertain terms that the limitations that I put on myself was really self-imposed, right?  That I really could do things that were outside of my comfort zone, that I had skillsets that weren't necessarily just technical.  And that's something when you grow up in a technical organization is really hard to see sometimes in yourself.  And then I, you know, poured a lot into the people around me in learning from them, and that paid off when it came to trying to figure out what I liked and what resonated with me.    Host:  It's important to sort of go for things that you think are something that interests you, too, but also as this level of sort of developing your skills, I'm finding myself doing it right now.  Because it's so easy to kind of fall back and say, \"I like this.  This is my comfort zone.  I'm very knowledgeable in this specific area.  If I go outside, you know, it's going to make me uncomfortable and I'm going to feel weird.  And it's not my thing.\"  So how do you push yourself?    Cathy Koerner:   It's actually harder for women than it is for men, actually.  There's studies that show that for a woman to apply for a position, for instance, they have to feel like they have 90% or more percent of the skills required to execute that position.  Whereas men, if they are in the 20% to 30% range, they think, \"Yeah, I could probably stretch and maybe do that.\"  And they're more likely to actually apply for jobs than women are.  And so one of the things I like to encourage women to do, especially the ones that I mentor, is to really try something new and different.  You don't know necessarily what your capabilities are outside of your comfort zone.  None of us really have a good self-awareness when it comes to that.  And you might find that doing something different actually helps you develop skills that you maybe don't even have today.    Host:  So that statistic, actually, is pretty reflective of a certain level of comfort.  You said women typically won't apply unless they have 90% of the skills.  There's a level of comfort with that.    Cathy Koerner:   Right, you bet.    Host:  This is something that I'm very familiar with that already -- but it's what do you have to do to sort of push yourself and say, \"Hey, maybe I only have 30% of the skills but I think I should try this\"?    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah, it's really -- it's just that, it's really you have to push yourself.  You have to say, \"You know what?  It's okay if I fail.\"  And that's sometimes a hard thing, especially for we as women and as a mom, right?  You never want to fail.  You always want to do everything.  You want to make sure your family is well taken of, your spouse is well taken care of, your household is taken care of, and oh by the way, work and all your employees are taken care of, right?  It's that sort of super mom mentality, right?  But in truth, it's okay to fail.  It's okay to try something and learn from that because it's really not a failure if you learn from the experience.    Host:  Is it more accepting to think of that just based on, like, a retrospective view, to say, \"You know what?  I've failed so many times, looking back that actually helped me.\"  But maybe there's a tip or something for how you approach okay, I might fail this, but I want to try.  Any sort of personal tip?    Cathy Koerner:   So all I can say is be persistent.  I don't know how else to say that.  I will tell you, for instance, when I interviewed to be the deputy director of Human Health and Performance, I actually felt like I did a horrible interview.  It came at a timeframe when I was in the middle of actually working a Russian rocket investigation.  So my mind was distracted on doing other things and I kind of wedged this interview in the midst of other activities going on.  And I told them, \"Hey, I'm sorry I'm distracted, and here's why I'm distracted.  But I'm going to do my best to keep you on track with your interview schedule.  So I'll do this interview.\"  I had done so poorly in the interview that I actually prepared a speech, a conciliatory speech saying thank you so much for considering me for this opportunity.  I would love some feedback.  I had this whole speech.  So when I was offered the job, I was dumbfounded.  I didn't know what to say.  Because I really didn't think I had gotten the job.  I didn't think I had done well enough in the interview.  So go back to say really, as an individual I'm probably my worst critic.   And sometimes that limits me.  And I have to get over that.  And having mentors who helped me to think that way, to think, \"Get over that, you're limiting yourself,\" that has really helped push me out of my comfort zone and try things that I never would have tried before.  Somebody with basically a propulsion background, a rocket scientist in charge of a health and medical organization is not typical.  And the reason it's not typical is because I was pushed and I pushed myself outside my comfort zone.    Host:  It is -- it's got to be that persistence, right?  Because even through the discomfort, through all of that, you just push anyway.  And even though you're, like, unsure and you're uncomfortable, it's through that pushing that you kind of get to where you want to be.  And is it fair to say that this is where you want to be, that this was your goal?    Cathy Koerner:   Absolutely love it.  Absolutely I love it.  And what I love about it is the people, right?  The organization is a fantastic organization.  We have a variety of work.  And we -- I like to tell people we put the human and human space flight, right?  We're the organization that makes sure that they are sustained, that they're successful, and that their performance meets the requirements of the programs.  And that's exciting to me.  That puts us right on the edge of everything that we do here at JSC and everything that we do at NASA.  It's exciting.    Host:  Yeah.  I love this theme of persistence, too.  And just kind of pushing through.  I wanted to go back to you gave, like, a nice snapshot of your biography in the beginning, but the first couple moments of your interest in STEM and the influence from your dad to get into it, but then also this inspiration to say, \"Hey, space.\"  How did that happen?  Was that push something that you wanted to do in the first place and maybe your dad helped you?    Cathy Koerner:   So it was kind of -- I grew up in the 1960's, right, when space was really cool.  I remember watching, you know, Apollo 11.  I remember thinking, \"Well, that's really cool, but why is everybody so excited about this?  Of course we can do something like this, we just have to put our minds to it, right?\"  And so all through my education I really -- I was pushed more from a discipline standpoint to just excel and to do well.  I never really knew that I could have a career in anything space-related.  I grew up in a suburb of Chicago, there's not a space business anywhere close by [Laughs].  Right?  And so for me, it was when I went to college, I actually started out in chemical engineering -- that was my major.  Because it was the hardest curriculum to get into at the University of Illinois and it was the easiest to transfer out of.  And so I knew that it was something if I could get into that, I could do anything.  And I did.  But then after a while, it really didn't interest me.  I had a friend who was in aero, and they said, \"Hey, come sit in some of our classes you and see what I think.   Maybe this would be something that interests you.\"  And it was only then that I really felt like, \"Oh, I could actually do this for -- like, this could be a career for me.  I could be involved in space stuff and not be an astronaut, right?\"  That's what everybody says, \"Oh, I want to be an astronaut.\"  I really never wanted to be an astronaut [Laughs].  The idea of leaving planet Earth just didn't -- it was very intimating to me but the idea of being involved in that kind of an adventure was very exciting.  And so it really wasn't until I was in college that I knew that that was even a possibility for a career.    Host:  So what kinds of challenges do you have in college?  I'm sure being a woman in engineering, you had certain challenges you to go through.    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah, especially -- yeah, in that timeframe.  I was only one of four women in my graduating class.    Host:  Oh, wow.  Oh, in the graduating class?    Cathy Koerner:   For aero, the year that I graduated.    Host:  Okay, okay.    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah.  Because there just weren't that many people going into aeronautical engineering at the time.    Host:  Of a class of how many?    Cathy Koerner:   Goodness, I don't remember.  I'm sorry.    Host:  Is it a couple hundred or is it, like, tens?    Cathy Koerner:   No, it's in the hundreds.    Host:  Oh, wow.  Oh, four in -- wow, okay.    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah.  So -- but it never dawned on me that that was odd.  I think because I was in -- I had a lot of guy friends, I was in classrooms with lots of men -- it never occurred to me that that was unique.  In fact, early in my flight control career when I was a propulsion officer, there was a shift -- a Shuttle handover.  So a handover is when you've got two teams of flight controllers, one is handing over to the other team.  And so two full teams of flight controllers during a Shuttle mission and someone pointed out to me that I was the only woman in the room.  Which is very different than it is today.  But at the time I was the only woman.  And I thought, \"So?\"  Because it didn't dawn on me that that was unique, but somebody else saw that as unique.  Because at the time, right, there weren't that many women in engineering disciplines and there certainly weren't that many women working in mission control.  Since then, that's changed dramatically.  If you look at a flight control team now, it's probably half women, which is fantastic.  I love seeing that.    Host:  [Laughs] So then how about your journey to become a flight controller?  I'm sure that was pretty challenging, too, because it was so abnormal?    Cathy Koerner:   Well, so when I came here to the Johnson Space Center, I was hired into a flight control position.  So that -- I don't know that that was so much of a journey.    Host:  Oh, okay.    Cathy Koerner:   But then becoming a flight director, again, was -- at that level was I was somebody that -- I enjoyed being a flight controller.  In fact, I initially didn't apply to be a flight director.  And then Wayne Hale, actually, of all people suggested, \"You should consider applying.\"  And I said, \"Well, why?\"  He said, \"Because you should consider applying.\"  He was one of those folks that kinds of pushed me outside my comfort zone.  And I applied.  And I was, like I said, fortunate to be selected in the class of 2000.  Annette Hasbrook was the other woman who was selected.  And when we were selected, there were only -- prior to us being selected, there had only been three other women who had actually been flight directors in the history of the American Space Flight program.    Host:  Incredible.    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah.  Pretty amazing.  So we felt very fortunate.    Host:  Do you think it was that idea of persistence that really made Wayne Hale want to say, \"You -- you should be the person to apply,\" or was it other characteristics that really stuck out?    Cathy Koerner:   I suspect he saw some other things in me, too.  He saw leadership qualities in me that maybe I didn't recognize in myself.  And he saw that I both had the technical discipline but also could lead and manage a team of various people.  Because at the time I was actually a group lead.  And so I had a number of people working for me.  So he saw things in me I maybe didn't see myself and still continues to this day to be a mentor of mine.    Host:  Oh, incredible.    Cathy Koerner:   Yeah.    Host:  All right.  Well, look at where you are now.  Now you're director of an entire division.  So that's --    Cathy Koerner:   Directorate but yeah.    Host:  Yeah, directorate.  That's right.  So awesome.  Cathy, thank you so much for coming on and kind of sharing your story.    Cathy Koerner:   Glad to be here.  Thanks so much for having me.    Host:  Of course.  Well, Jenny, that wraps up our guests for this episode.  Thanks so much for helping to get these incredible women and leaders at NASA on the podcast today.    Jenny Turner:   My pleasure.  Thanks so much for having us and for teaming up with us to do this.  Really excited to get these incredible role models out, even for myself personally.  I know many women are at the center.  So I'm glad that we can highlight some of those stories today.    Host:  Definitely.  Even talking to them it's just, like, wow.  It's just, like, I love that idea of perseverance and this whole theme just coming together.  So I'm glad we can team up for this.  So usually at the end we do some places you can go to get more information about NASA.  So I'll just kind of start with the Johnson Space Center since WELL is a part of it, right?  So NASA.gov/Johnson.  You can learn everything that's going on here.  And then also on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, you can look for the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts.  And then Jenny, you follow those accounts, right?    Jenny Turner:   Of course, who wouldn't?    Host:  Okay, good.  If you're here, you have to follow this.     [ Laughter ]   Okay.  But if you're listening to this, you can use the #NASA on one of those accounts, whatever platform that is your favorite, to submit an idea or maybe a question for the podcast, and we'll make sure to answer it on one of the future episodes.  Just make sure it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast because that's how we find it.  There are plenty of other podcasts out there, particularly NASA ones.  NASA and Silicon Valley, our friends over at AMES, they're doing some great stuff with Twitch TV, doing some live podcasts on TV.  And then also you can check out NASA's Gravity Assist hosted by Jim Green up at -- Jim Green up at headquarters.  So this podcast was recorded in March 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Kelly Humphries, and Jessica Voss, and Kris Davis over at WELL, and, of course, to you, Jenny --    Jenny Turner:   You're welcome.    Host:  -- for coming on to help put this together.  Thanks to all of our guests for coming on the show: Dana Weigel, Ginger Kerrick, Julie Kramer White, and Cathy Koerner.  Happy Women's History Month.  We'll be back next week.     [ Music ]",

            "description": "“I was born in India soon after we got independence from the British. So we were just beginning to get access to education. My mother was very keen that her daughters get an education. She was a big motivating force behind my interest in science. Since I was really little, she would say, ‘This daughter of mine is going to be a scientist.’   “And I loved nature. In those days, the monsoon would make India come to life with flowers and creepy-crawlies and all kinds of little creatures. I would just go out, eagerly looking for new forms of life. I was always curious. And I remember the night sky — just trying to count all the stars. We didn’t have electricity so it was very dark. You could see the Milky Way, it was so clear.   “When Sputnik was launched, it came out in the newspaper that you would be able to see it pass overhead at 5 in the morning. And my grandmother woke up everyone — the entire household — to see it. There was a big crowd in the backyard to watch Sputnik go by.   \"Then, Yuri Gagarin made a tour of India. He came to our city — Lucknow — and there was a reception for him. My mother got invitations for all of us to see the cosmonaut. We were just little kids. We ran right to the stage — there was no security then — and said hello to him. He gave us little booklets and autographs. It was a big inspiration for me. I remember just staring at that booklet he gave me. I kept it for years.”  NASA Program Scientist, Dr. Hashima Hasan, poses for a portrait in her backyard, while working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Monday, July 6, 2020 in Maryland. Hasan currently works at NASA Headquarters as a program scientist on the agency’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) spacecraft, the Keck Observatory, and the NASA Astrophysics Archives, and is the deputy program scientist for NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope.
